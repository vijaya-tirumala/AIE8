ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

pre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or
export the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute
any query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a

Data and Privacy
In this section, we describe the data used in the paper and the privacy safeguards we implemented. No
member of the research team ever saw the content of user messages, and all analyses were conducted
in accordance with OpenAI’s Privacy Policy (OpenAI, 2025c).
The analysis in this paper is based on the following datasets:
1. Growth: total daily message volumes from consumer ChatGPT users between November 2022
and September 2025, along with basic self-reported demographic information. This dataset is
primarily used in Section 4.
2. Classified messages: messages classified into coarse categories.
• Sampled from all ChatGPT users: a random sample of approximately one million de-
identified messages from logged-in consumer ChatGPT users between May 2024 and June

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported"

Key features and capabilities that distinguished this version from its predecessors included:

1. **Conversational Ability**: ChatGPT was designed for engaging in human-like conversations, allowing users to interact in a more natural manner compared to earlier models.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform was accessible and easy to use, which encouraged widespread adoption and interaction.

3. **Rapid Growth**: Following its launch, ChatGPT quickly gained popularity, amassing over one million registered users within just a few days, highlighting its appeal and functionality.

4. **Feedback Mechanism**: As a research preview, it was positioned to gather user feedback, which could be used to improve the model and its responses over time.

5. **Versatility in Text Generation**: It was capable of generating detailed and contextually relevant text responses based on user prompts, showcasing advancements in natural language processing.

These features contributed to its rapid adoption and set the stage for subsequent updates and versions, such as GPT-4 and beyond.","C

and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A
chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

1. **Practical Guidance**: This topic remains constant at roughly 29% of overall usage. Users are likely seeking actionable advice or strategies related to various aspects of their lives, including technology, health, and personal development.

2. **Seeking Information**: This topic has seen growth, increasing from 14% to 24% of all usage over the specified period. Users are actively looking for information across different domains, which likely includes inquiries about technology trends, health-related questions, and personal development resources.

3. **Writing**: Although this topic has seen a decline from 36% to 24% in overall usage, it remains a significant aspect of user interactions. Many users may seek assistance in writing related to technology (such as technical documents), health (like wellness articles), and personal development (such as self-help materials).

Together, these three topics—Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing—account for a substantial portion of ChatGPT conversations, collectively representing nearly 78% of all messages.","Topic

Table 3: Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories
Figure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation
Topics are Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing, collectively accounting for about
77% of all ChatGPT conversations. Practical Guidance has remained constant at roughly 29% of
overall usage. Writing has declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later. Seeking
Information has grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share of Technical

queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.
Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance, Writing,
and Seeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.
Computer Pro-
gramming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages
respectively.
Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages
overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About
two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text
from scratch.
Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we
call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,
advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process

Information has grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share of Technical
Help declined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because
the use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),
for AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex). Multimedia
grew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-
generation capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.
Figure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About
40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 are Writing, by far the most common Conversation

1. **Initial Percentage (June 2024)**: 53%
2. **Final Percentage (June 2025)**: 73%

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Percentage} - \text{Initial Percentage}}{\text{Initial Percentage}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{73 - 53}{53} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{20}{53} \right) \times 100 \approx 37.74\%
\]

Thus, the percentage increase in non-work-related messages was approximately **37.74%**.

Regarding the factors that contributed to this growth, the context indicates that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, with non-work-related messages growing faster. It also notes that successive cohorts of users have had a higher share of non-work messages, and within each cohort, non-work use has increased. Additionally, it mentions that usage has become less work-related over time for users of all ages. 

The specific contributing factors to the growth in non-work-related messages include:
- An increase in the share of non-work messages among successive user cohorts.
- A general trend where all age groups are using the platform less for work-related purposes over time, with notable differences in non-work-related message shares among younger users compared to older users.

In summary, the percentage increase in non-work-related messages was approximately 37.74%, driven by changes in user cohorts and a broader trend of decreasing work-related usage across all age groups.","Table 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however
non-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which
climbed to 73% by June 2025.
Figure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-
sive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work
use has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest
cohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.

1. **Age Groups**: The early adopters were predominantly younger individuals. The context indicates that generative AI, including ChatGPT, is used more frequently by young people.

2. **Professions**: While the context does not specify particular professions, it does note that usage varies by education and occupation. It suggests that those with tertiary and/or graduate education are more likely to adopt this technology, which may imply that early adopters included professionals in sectors that value advanced education.

3. **Geographic Regions**: The early adopters were found to be disproportionately located in lower-income countries, where the growth rates of adoption were identified as higher. This contrasts with earlier patterns where usage was more frequent in wealthier countries.

4. **Gender**: The early adopters were predominantly male, although the gender gap in adoption has narrowed over time.

Factors contributing to the adoption of ChatGPT among these groups include:
- The appeal of generative AI technologies to younger demographics, who may be more comfortable with digital tools.
- The educational background of users, as those with higher education levels may see more utility in ChatGPT for work and other tasks.
- The rapid growth and accessibility of the technology, which likely made it more appealing in lower-income regions where traditional resources may be less available.

ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

The Growth of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December
5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active
users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after
one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than
700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population.20

Key features and capabilities introduced during this launch included:

1. **Text-Based Interaction**: Users could submit plain-text messages (prompts) and receive generated text responses from the underlying language model (LLM).

2. **Statistical Model Functionality**: ChatGPT was designed as a statistical model trained to maximize the quality of responses based on input prompts.

3. **User Engagement**: The platform allowed for conversational exchanges, which became the typical mode of interaction despite subsequent additions of more advanced features.

While the context mentions the potential for additional features (like web searching and image generation) being added later, these were not part of the initial launch capabilities. Thus, the primary interaction at launch was focused on generating text-based responses.","C

and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A
chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

Additionally, it does not detail the differences in usage between free and subscription-based accounts.

However, it does mention that by July 2025, the total messages sent grew significantly, specifically by a factor of more than 5 between July 2024 and July 2025. It also indicates that there has been dramatic growth in message volume for both new and existing cohorts of users, with earlier sign-ups exhibiting consistently higher usage that has also grown over time.

Additionally, the context references the likelihood that messages are work-related, conditioned on user age, but does not provide specific age group breakdowns or weekly message averages. Similarly, it discusses global patterns of usage by measuring the proportion of weekly users among the internet-enabled population but does not specify the average messages sent by users in different countries or economic statuses.

In summary, while the context provides insights into the growth of message volume and user engagement trends, it lacks the specific numerical data required to answer the question fully.","Figure 4: Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of

There has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth
in existing cohorts.
Figure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-
resents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that
earlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within
every cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,
and (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.

The context mentions that ChatGPT usage varies across different regions and demographic factors, including age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Key points from the context include:

1. **Age**: Nearly half of all messages sent by adults using ChatGPT were from users under the age of 26, indicating a strong usage among younger demographics.

2. **Gender**: There has been a notable shift in gender representation among users, with more than half of the weekly active users having typically female first names as of July 2025, suggesting that gender gaps in usage have likely closed significantly.

3. **Education and Occupation**: Users with higher levels of education (those with a bachelor's degree or some graduate education) are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related messages. The proportion of work-related messages increases with education level, indicating a correlation between educational attainment and ChatGPT usage.

4. **Income Level**: ChatGPT usage has grown rapidly in low- and middle-income countries, suggesting that economic factors also influence the adoption of this technology.

Overall, while the context provides insights into the demographic variations in ChatGPT usage, it does not provide specific percentage breakdowns across these demographics. Therefore, while we can infer trends regarding age, gender, education, and income levels, exact percentages for these groups are not detailed in the provided context.","Figure 21: ChatGPT Weekly Active Users as Share of Internet Population vs GDP decile, May 2024 vs May

regression-adjusted results.
Educated users are much more likely to use ChatGPT for work. 37% of messages are work-related
for users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for users with exactly a bachelor’s
degree and 48% for those with some graduate education. Those differences are cut roughly in half
after adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1

faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that
measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.
Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,
more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages
sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially
fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly
educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related
messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work.
Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.

However, it does not delve deeply into the specific machine learning architectures or algorithms that underpin ChatGPT. 

Based on the mention of ChatGPT as a statistical model trained to generate text responses, it can be inferred that it utilizes a transformer-based architecture, which is a common framework for modern language models. Transformers allow for efficient processing of context in sequences of text, enabling the model to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

In terms of differences from previous iterations of language models, the following points can be made based on the context:

1. **Training Data**: While the context does not specify the exact nature of the training data, it implies that updates to the model's weights and system prompts are included in newer iterations, suggesting that more recent models may leverage larger and more diverse datasets compared to earlier versions.

2. **Performance Metrics**: The context mentions that the quality of responses is measured using a variety of metrics, including user satisfaction and feedback. This indicates that newer iterations of ChatGPT may have improved performance metrics compared to earlier models, specifically in generating responses that users find satisfying and relevant.

3. **Practical Applications**: The context highlights ChatGPT's role in providing decision support, particularly in knowledge-intensive jobs. This suggests that while earlier language models may have been more focused on generating text, the latest iterations are designed to enhance productivity and decision-making in professional environments, indicating a shift towards practical applications that directly support user productivity.

In summary, while the context provides some insights into the evolution and application of ChatGPT, it lacks specific details about the underlying machine learning algorithms and architectures. Nevertheless, it does suggest advancements in training data, performance metrics, and practical applications over previous iterations of language models.","and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b).

How does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that
ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in
knowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et
al., 2023). This explains why Asking is relatively more common for educated users who are employed
in highly-paid, professional occupations.
Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas
(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either as co-workers that produce output or
as co-pilots that give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.

This indicates a shift towards more casual and personal interactions rather than strictly professional ones, suggesting that users are finding value in ChatGPT for a broader range of conversations. The authors note that ""Asking"" messages, which include queries and requests for information, have outpaced ""Doing"" messages, which involve actionable tasks. This trend indicates a growing preference for seeking information and guidance from the chatbot, reflecting a change in communication style that leans towards inquiry and engagement rather than task completion.

The authors also highlight demographic shifts in user engagement, noting that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has narrowed, with more female users engaging with the platform. Additionally, a substantial portion of users is under the age of 26, indicating that younger demographics are driving engagement with ChatGPT. The findings suggest that ChatGPT is becoming a ubiquitous tool across various demographics, including low- and middle-income countries, which have seen especially rapid growth in usage.

The authors' backgrounds influence their interpretations of these aspects in several ways. Aaron Chatterji, Thomas Cunningham, and David J. Deming, being economists, may emphasize the economic implications of ChatGPT's adoption and its role in the global economy. Their focus on demographic changes and usage patterns likely stems from a desire to understand the broader societal impacts of technology. Other authors in the group, such as Zoe Hitzig and Christopher Ong, may bring perspectives related to social behavior and communication styles, enriching the analysis of how ChatGPT affects interpersonal interactions.

In summary, the authors document a significant evolution in user engagement with ChatGPT, characterized by increased inquiry-driven interactions and demographic diversification. Their academic backgrounds shape their interpretations, balancing economic analysis with insights into communication styles and societal trends.","NBER WORKING PAPER SERIES

(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown
faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that
measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.
Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,
more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages
sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially
fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly
educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related
messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work.
Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.

ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more"

The NBER is a prominent research organization known for its contributions to economic research, particularly through the dissemination of working papers that are circulated for discussion before formal peer review and publication.

In terms of research focus, the NBER is recognized for its emphasis on empirical economic analysis and policy-oriented research. It serves as a platform for economists to share preliminary findings and foster dialogue among researchers, policymakers, and the public. This is evidenced by the working paper's purpose, which is to explore the usage of ChatGPT, likely within an economic framework or its implications for economic behavior.

Comparatively, the other organizations mentioned in the document, such as those associated with the authors of the cited works, may have different research focuses. For example, the publication by Chetty et al. in Nature emphasizes social capital and economic mobility, highlighting a broader social science perspective. Similarly, the work by Chiang et al. presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning focuses on evaluating large language models, which falls under the domain of machine learning and computer science rather than traditional economics.

Overall, while NBER's primary focus is on economic research, the contributions from other organizations reflect a more diverse range of research themes, including social sciences and artificial intelligence. This indicates that while NBER is instrumental in advancing economic research, other institutions contribute significantly to interdisciplinary studies that intersect with economics, technology, and social behavior. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the depth or impact of research across these organizations, limiting a full analysis.","Economic Research.

Several factors contributed to the differing adoption rates based on demographic trends and technological advancements discussed in the document:

1. **Demographic Trends**: 
   - **Gender Disparity**: Early adopters of ChatGPT were predominantly male, but this gender gap has narrowed over time, suggesting increasing inclusivity and broader interest among women.
   - **Income Levels**: There was noted higher growth rates of adoption in lower-income countries, which may reflect the accessibility and appeal of ChatGPT as a cost-effective resource for individuals in those regions.

2. **Usage Patterns**: 
   - The context highlights a shift in usage patterns, with a significant increase in non-work-related messages, which grew from 53% to over 70% of all usage. This trend suggests that users are finding diverse applications for ChatGPT beyond professional contexts, potentially driving broader adoption.

3. **Technological Advancements**: 
   - ChatGPT is built on advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have accelerated the capabilities of AI technologies. This progression in technology may have made ChatGPT more attractive and user-friendly compared to its predecessors or similar offerings.

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

This launch date is notable because it set the stage for subsequent advancements in AI models developed by OpenAI. Following ChatGPT's launch, several key events occurred in the timeline of OpenAI's AI model releases:

1. **February 1, 2023**: The launch of the ChatGPT Plus subscription service.
2. **March 14, 2023**: The introduction of GPT-4 within ChatGPT Plus.
3. **Subsequent launches**: These included various iterations and enhancements of the model, such as GPT-4o and eventually GPT-5, with releases extending into 2025.

In comparison to the launch of ChatGPT, GPT-4's availability came just a few months later, indicating a rapid progression in model development. This timeline underscores how quickly OpenAI evolved its offerings following the initial release of ChatGPT.

Technologically, ChatGPT distinguished itself from its predecessors through several advancements and features:

- **Underlying Model**: ChatGPT initially utilized GPT-3.5, a significant step from earlier models. This model offered improved performance in generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
- **Web and Database Integration**: ChatGPT introduced capabilities allowing the model to search the web and access external databases, enhancing the breadth of information it could provide in responses.
- **Image Generation**: Subsequent versions added the ability to generate images based on text prompts, expanding the interactivity and versatility of the platform.
- **User Engagement Metrics**: By July 2025, ChatGPT had achieved remarkable user engagement, with over 700 million users sending approximately 2.5 billion messages per day, highlighting its rapid adoption and integration into daily use.

Overall, the launch of ChatGPT marked a significant milestone in AI development, showcasing advancements in model capabilities, user interactivity, and feature enhancements that set the course for future iterations.","C

and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A
chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

This increase reflects a rising trend in users looking for specific knowledge or answers, which can also foster engagement as users may participate in back-and-forth dialogues to clarify their inquiries.
   - **Writing**: This topic has seen a decline from 36% to 24%. Despite the drop, it remains a substantial area of engagement, especially among users in management and business, where writing is critical. The majority of writing-related requests involve modifying existing text rather than creating new content, indicating a nuanced engagement where users are actively involved in refining their work.

2. **Complexity of Responses Required**: 
   - **Practical Guidance** typically requires complex and context-aware responses, as users may ask for step-by-step advice on various topics.
   - **Seeking Information** may vary in complexity depending on the specificity of the question. Some inquiries may demand detailed, nuanced answers, while others could be straightforward factual responses.
   - **Writing** requests may require varying levels of complexity. While some users may need simple corrections, others might seek comprehensive editing or creative writing, necessitating more intricate responses.

3. **Underlying Themes**: 
   - The themes of **assistance and support** are prevalent across all three topics. Users are actively looking for help, whether through direct guidance, information-seeking, or writing support. 
   - The trend towards increased **information-seeking** suggests a growing curiosity or need for knowledge, which can be attributed to a more informed user base or a shift in user priorities.
   - The decline in **writing** could indicate a saturation in that area or a shift toward more immediate, practical applications of ChatGPT’s capabilities, reflecting changing user needs or preferences over time.

In summary, the three most common topics in ChatGPT conversations exhibit significant user engagement, with varying complexities in response requirements. The underlying themes emphasize a consistent demand for assistance, a growing curiosity for information, and a potential shift in how users engage with writing tasks.","Topic

respectively.
Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages
overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About
two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text
from scratch.
Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we
call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,
advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process"

First, the study reveals that successive cohorts of users have a higher share of non-work messages, suggesting that newer users may be more inclined to use the platform for non-work purposes. Additionally, within each cohort, the non-work use has also increased, indicating a general trend toward a greater focus on non-work-related communications over time.

Comparatively, work-related messages saw a decrease from 47% in June 2024 to 27% in June 2025. This decline in work-related messages, alongside the rapid growth of non-work-related messages, highlights a significant shift in user intent and behavior, with users increasingly favoring non-work interactions.

Overall, the growth of non-work-related messages was more pronounced than the changes observed in work-related messages during the same period, reflecting a broader trend in user engagement with the platform.","Table 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however
non-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which
climbed to 73% by June 2025.
Figure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-
sive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work
use has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest
cohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.

ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

This significant volume indicates a high level of engagement among users. However, the context does not provide specific comparative figures for the average weekly message volume across other AI platforms, making it impossible to draw direct comparisons.

Several factors contributed to the observed differences in user engagement and messaging patterns between ChatGPT and other AI technologies. Firstly, the rapid growth in message volume was attributed to both the introduction of new cohorts of users and increased activity from existing users. The data suggests that earlier sign-ups had consistently higher usage rates, but all cohorts experienced growth over time. 

Improvements in the capabilities of the models played a crucial role in enhancing user engagement. As users became more familiar with the technology, they discovered new uses for existing capabilities, leading to increased messaging activity. The context also highlights that a significant portion of ChatGPT queries (about 70%) were unrelated to work, with non-work queries growing faster than work-related ones. 

Additionally, demographic trends showed that a large portion of users were younger individuals, and there was a notable closing of gender gaps in usage. This broad demographic appeal, along with the rapid adoption observed particularly in low- and middle-income countries, likely contributed to the high engagement levels seen with ChatGPT.

In summary, while the precise comparison to other AI platforms is not available, the factors influencing ChatGPT's user engagement include model improvements, broad demographic appeal, and the discovery of new use cases, all contributing to its rapid growth in message volume.","Figure 4: Daily message volumes from ChatGPT consumer plans (Free, Plus, Pro), split by sign-up date of

While the specific percentage of adults using social media platforms is not provided in the context, it is widely known that social media usage typically encompasses a significant portion of the global adult population, often exceeding 50% in many regions. 

The implications of these figures for digital engagement trends across different demographics are noteworthy:

1. **Diverse Engagement**: The substantial percentage of adults using ChatGPT (10%) suggests that this platform has gained significant traction among adults, particularly in comparison to social media, which has a broader user base. This indicates that while social media remains a dominant form of digital engagement, specialized tools like ChatGPT are carving out a significant niche, especially for work-related tasks.

2. **Demographic Shifts**: The context notes that ChatGPT usage is particularly high among younger users (under 26) and educated individuals, indicating that these demographics are more inclined to engage with AI-driven platforms for practical applications. This trend may suggest a shift in how younger adults prefer to communicate and perform tasks, potentially impacting the future of workplace interactions and educational tools.

3. **Global Impact**: The rapid growth of ChatGPT usage, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, highlights the potential for digital engagement tools to bridge gaps in communication and information access across different economies. This could lead to more equitable access to information and resources, significantly affecting global economic dynamics.

4. **Gender Parity**: The closing gender gap in ChatGPT usage, with more than half of the users having typically female names, indicates a shift in engagement patterns and may reflect broader societal changes in technology adoption among different genders.

In summary, while we cannot directly compare the percentage of ChatGPT users with social media users from the provided context, the implications of the 10% figure for ChatGPT usage suggest significant trends in digital engagement that are influenced by age, education, and global economic status. These trends indicate a diversification of how adults engage with digital platforms, moving beyond traditional social media to more specialized applications like ChatGPT.","Figure 21: ChatGPT Weekly Active Users as Share of Internet Population vs GDP decile, May 2024 vs May

The Growth of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December
5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active
users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after
one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than
700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population.20

### Architecture
ChatGPT is built on the transformer architecture, a design that has become the backbone of many state-of-the-art language models. The transformer model allows for efficient processing of large amounts of text data by utilizing mechanisms like self-attention, which enables the model to weigh the importance of different words relative to each other. Compared to earlier architectures such as RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), transformers provide superior performance in understanding context and generating coherent text.

### Training Methodologies
The training of ChatGPT involves a two-step process: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model learns from a vast corpus of text using unsupervised learning, where it predicts the next word in a sentence. Fine-tuning is conducted with supervised learning on specific tasks, often involving user interactions and feedback to enhance its performance in generating human-like responses. This iterative improvement process contributes to the model's adaptability to user needs and feedback, making it more refined than some other models that may not prioritize such ongoing training.

### Applications
ChatGPT's applications are diverse, ranging from simple chatbots to complex decision-support systems. Its ability to generate customized responses allows it to serve various functions, such as providing tailored advice, generating creative content, and offering practical guidance. These capabilities make ChatGPT particularly valuable in knowledge-intensive professions where decision-making and productivity are paramount.

### Performance Implications
The performance of ChatGPT is enhanced by its architecture and training methodologies, leading to higher user satisfaction and better quality responses compared to some other models. Its flexibility and ability to generate novel content based on user input create a competitive advantage, especially in scenarios requiring personalized interaction.

### Ethical Considerations
The implications of ChatGPT's technology also extend to ethical considerations. The model's capacity for generating human-like text raises concerns about misinformation, bias, and the potential for misuse. As it is frequently updated and fine-tuned based on user interactions, there is a continuous need for oversight and ethical guidelines to ensure responsible use. The economic value it provides, particularly in professional contexts, must be weighed against these ethical challenges.

In summary, ChatGPT's transformer-based architecture, robust training methodologies, and wide-ranging applications position it as a leader among AI language models. However, this performance comes with significant ethical considerations that need to be addressed as the technology continues to evolve.","and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b).

have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

ChatGPT is also more flexible than web
search even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because
users receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy
football team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided
content and follow-up requests.

This growth in non-work usage is occurring at a faster rate than work-related queries, suggesting a broad adoption of ChatGPT for various purposes beyond professional tasks. The implications of this trend highlight the potential for substantial welfare gains from generative AI, as indicated by the estimated surplus of at least $97 billion a year for U.S. users who value their access to the technology.

In contrast, the identified challenges and benefits of AI-driven customer interactions point to a dual role that AI can play—serving as both a co-worker that produces output and as a co-pilot that enhances decision-making. The paper suggests that while ChatGPT improves worker output by providing decision support, its primary value lies in its ability to assist users, particularly in knowledge-intensive jobs. This aligns with the observation that educated users in professional occupations tend to engage more with Asking messages, which are rated higher in quality by users and classifiers.

The implications of comparing these findings suggest that future marketing strategies should consider the diverse applications of ChatGPT. Marketers could tailor their approaches to leverage the growing trend in non-work usage by highlighting the technology’s versatility in various contexts—ranging from casual inquiries to professional support. Additionally, understanding that users derive significant value as advisors or research assistants could lead to more targeted marketing campaigns that address specific needs in both personal and professional spheres.

Overall, the data indicates that as the landscape of consumer interactions with AI evolves, marketing strategies must adapt to encompass both the growing non-work-related engagement and the ongoing value derived from work-related decision support, ultimately positioning ChatGPT as a multifaceted tool in consumers' lives.","7
Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.

Doing, and that Asking messages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier
that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.
How does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that
ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in
knowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et
al., 2023). This explains why Asking is relatively more common for educated users who are employed
in highly-paid, professional occupations.
Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas
(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either as co-workers that produce output or
as co-pilots that give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.

Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.
The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI
usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to
be paid $98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least $97 billion a
year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT
as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly.
Still,
ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important
in knowledge-intensive jobs where productivity is increasing in the quality of decision-making.

Furthermore, compare their conclusions with existing literature on AI usage to evaluate any shifts in perception or new insights that emerge from this paper.","Who are the authors of the working paper titled ""How People Use ChatGPT""?","The authors of the working paper titled ""How People Use ChatGPT"" bring diverse backgrounds and expertise that significantly shape the perspectives and findings presented in the paper. Each author likely contributes unique insights based on their respective fields, which include economics, labor studies, and data analysis. For instance, David J. Deming’s work on labor markets and productivity can inform the analysis of how ChatGPT enhances worker output, particularly in knowledge-intensive jobs. Similarly, the expertise of Aaron Chatterji and Thomas Cunningham in economic policy may influence the exploration of economic value derived from AI technologies.

The individual contributions of the authors help to create a well-rounded examination of user interactions with ChatGPT. Their findings suggest that ChatGPT serves as a decision support tool, which is especially beneficial for educated users in high-paying, professional occupations. This insight is particularly relevant in understanding how AI tools can improve productivity and decision-making processes in the workforce.

The implications of these findings extend to our understanding of user interactions with AI technologies. By highlighting demographic differences in usage patterns—such as greater use among younger, educated individuals—the paper underscores the potential socioeconomic divides in access to and benefit from AI tools. This reinforces existing literature that notes disparities in AI usage by demographic groups, as seen in studies by Bick et al. (2024) and Hartley et al. (2025). 

Furthermore, the authors' conclusions align with the model proposed by Ide and Talamas (2025), which categorizes AI agents as either co-workers or co-pilots. This framework helps contextualize the role of ChatGPT in augmenting human problem-solving rather than replacing it. The paper confirms and expands on existing literature by providing a global perspective and detailed demographic analysis, indicating a possible shift in perception towards recognizing the nuanced roles that AI technologies play in professional settings.

In summary, the authors' diverse expertise enriches the analysis in the paper, and their findings reflect and build upon existing literature on AI usage, offering new insights into the economic and social dynamics of interacting with AI technologies like ChatGPT.","Doing, and that Asking messages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

Privacy via a Data Clean Room.
We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.
All analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only
pre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or
export the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute
any query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a
committee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only
approved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).
Our partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting
a threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever
visible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-

employment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research
team had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report
aggregates for groups with less than 100 users.
In following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by
other social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.
We follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.

This rapid adoption rate is noteworthy as it represents an unprecedented speed of global diffusion for a new technology, surpassing the early adoption phases of other technological advancements such as smartphones and social media.

In comparison, the adoption rates of smartphones and social media during their respective early phases were significantly slower. For instance, smartphones took several years to reach comparable penetration levels, as did social media platforms, which often required users to build networks and engage with content over time. The context suggests that the rapid growth of ChatGPT can be attributed to several factors, including:

1. **Immediate Utility**: ChatGPT offers immediate and versatile applications, with a notable increase in non-work-related queries (growing from 53% to over 70% of usage), demonstrating its relevance in everyday life.
2. **Global Reach**: The technology has seen higher growth rates in lower-income countries, indicating broad accessibility and appeal.
3. **Gender Gap Reduction**: While early adopters were predominantly male, the narrowing gender gap suggests that the technology is becoming more universally accepted and utilized.

The implications of these trends for future developments in AI technology and its integration into daily life are profound. The swift adoption of ChatGPT could signal a growing familiarity and comfort with AI tools, paving the way for more advanced AI applications in various sectors. Furthermore, as non-work-related usage continues to increase, it may influence how people interact with technology, emphasizing the importance of AI in leisure and personal contexts, not just professional ones. This shift could encourage further innovation and integration of AI solutions into everyday activities, ultimately reshaping societal norms and economic structures.

ddfdc969-ec91-47c3-ac41-7b2aa69a89e0,reasoning,"In the context of ChatGPT conversations, identify the three most common topics discussed and evaluate how these topics reflect broader societal trends or issues. In your analysis, consider the reasons behind the prevalence of these topics, the implications they have on user engagement and satisfaction, and how they compare to conversations held with other AI chatbots. Additionally, synthesize how these common topics might influence the development of future AI models and their capacities to address emerging societal concerns.",What are the three most common topics of ChatGPT conversations?,"Based on the provided context, the three most common topics discussed in ChatGPT conversations can be inferred to include:

1. **Seeking Information**: Users frequently engage with ChatGPT to ask questions and seek information on a variety of subjects. This reflects a broader societal trend where individuals increasingly rely on AI for immediate access to knowledge rather than traditional search engines. The rise of ""asking"" messages, which have shown faster growth and higher quality ratings, indicates a shift towards interactive information-gathering.

2. **Practical Guidance**: Many users seek practical advice or guidance, such as tailored workout plans, product ideas, or creative brainstorming (e.g., fantasy football team names). This trend mirrors a growing desire for personalized and actionable insights, highlighting an emphasis on self-improvement and creativity in modern society. The customization aspect of generative AI addresses this need, making it more appealing than static information sources.

3. **Work-Related Messages**: There is a notable presence of professional inquiries among users, particularly those who are highly educated and in professional occupations. This reflects the increasing integration of AI into workplace practices, where users leverage ChatGPT for productivity, efficiency, and problem-solving. The notable engagement from younger users and the closing gender gap also suggest that diverse demographics are utilizing AI tools for career advancement.

**Evaluation of Prevalence and Implications**:
The prevalence of these topics can be attributed to several factors:

- **User Engagement and Satisfaction**: The ability of ChatGPT to provide tailored and contextually relevant responses enhances user satisfaction, encouraging more interactions. The dynamic nature of conversation—where users can follow up and refine their queries—improves the overall experience compared to traditional search engines.

- **Comparison with Other AI Chatbots**: ChatGPT's flexibility and advanced capabilities differentiate it from other AI chatbots, which may focus on more rigid, scripted responses. This leads to higher engagement levels, especially in contexts requiring nuanced understanding and adaptability.

**Impact on Future AI Model Development**:
The identified common topics suggest significant implications for the future development of AI models:

- **Customization and Personalization**: Future AI models may need to enhance their capabilities for personalization further, adapting to individual user preferences and contexts to maintain engagement. As users increasingly seek tailored guidance, AI must evolve to provide more nuanced and specific responses.

- **Broader Societal Concerns**: As societal trends shift towards rapid information access and self-improvement, AI models might need to address emerging issues such as misinformation, ethical considerations in advice-giving, and the impact of AI on job roles. This necessitates integrating safeguards and ethical frameworks into future AI design.

In summary, the prevalent topics of seeking information, practical guidance, and work-related inquiries reflect broader societal trends towards personalization, efficiency, and the integration of AI into everyday life. These trends will likely shape the ongoing development of AI technologies, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, user engagement, and ethical considerations.","distinguishes generative AI from existing technologies.
ChatGPT is also more flexible than web
search even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because
users receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy
football team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided
content and follow-up requests.

User Intent

(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown
faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that
measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.
Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,
more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages
sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially
fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly
educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related
messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work.
Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.

How did shifts in workplace communication dynamics influence this trend, and what implications might this have for employee productivity and workplace culture? Additionally, compare this growth rate to other forms of communication (e.g., work-related messages) to assess whether this trend reflects a broader change in communication priorities within organizations.",How much did non-work-related messages grow from 53% to by the time of the study?,"The analysis of the growth of non-work-related messages, which increased from 53% in June 2024 to 73% by June 2025, indicates a significant shift in communication dynamics within the workplace. This 20% increase reflects a growing trend where employees are engaging in more personal or informal interactions, as evidenced by the cumulative sign-up cohorts that show a higher share of non-work messages and increasing non-work use within each cohort.

Several factors may have contributed to this increase in non-work-related messages. Firstly, the evolving workplace culture, particularly with the rise of remote work and flexible work arrangements, might encourage employees to foster personal connections through informal communication. This shift could lead to a more relaxed communication environment where employees feel comfortable sharing non-work-related content, resulting in a higher volume of such messages.

Additionally, the data presented in Figure 12 indicates that the intent behind messages is shifting, with a notable rise in ""Asking"" messages (51.6%) compared to ""Doing"" (34.6%) and ""Expressing"" (13.8%). This trend suggests that employees are increasingly seeking information or engaging in discussions that are not strictly work-focused, further contributing to the growth of non-work-related communications.

The implications of this trend for employee productivity and workplace culture can be profound. On one hand, the increase in informal communication can enhance workplace relationships, foster a sense of belonging, and improve overall morale. On the other hand, if non-work-related messages distract from work tasks, there could be potential impacts on productivity. Organizations may need to find a balance, encouraging informal interactions while ensuring that work efficiency is not compromised.

When comparing this growth rate of non-work-related messages to work-related messages, which saw a decline from 47% to 27%, it is evident that the prioritization of communication within organizations is shifting. This dramatic difference suggests a broader change in communication priorities, where the emphasis may be moving away from strictly professional interactions towards a more holistic approach to employee well-being and engagement.

In conclusion, the significant growth of non-work-related messages represents a key shift in workplace communication dynamics, influenced by cultural changes and employee preferences. While this trend can foster a positive workplace culture, organizations must remain vigilant to ensure that productivity is not adversely affected.","Table 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however
non-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which
climbed to 73% by June 2025.
Figure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-
sive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work
use has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest
cohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.

Additionally, why might these characteristics influence the speed and manner in which various groups integrate AI technologies into their daily lives?",Which demographic was identified as early adopters of ChatGPT?,"The characteristics of early adopters of ChatGPT exhibit several similarities and differences when compared to early adopters of similar technological innovations. Based on the context provided, early adopters of ChatGPT were initially disproportionately male, but this gender gap has been narrowing. Additionally, early adopters tend to be younger and possess higher levels of education, aligning with trends observed in the adoption of other technological innovations. However, a notable distinction is the faster growth rate of ChatGPT adoption in lower-income countries compared to previous technologies, indicating a broader global reach and accessibility.

These characteristics suggest that early adopters of ChatGPT, like those of other innovations, are often more technologically savvy and willing to experiment with new tools. The narrowing gender gap in usage implies that as the technology matures, it becomes more appealing across a wider demographic, potentially leading to a more balanced adoption across genders. Furthermore, the growth in adoption among lower-income countries could reflect a desire for inexpensive and efficient solutions to various challenges, thus broadening the technological landscape.

Understanding these characteristics has profound implications for assessing the broader societal impacts of AI adoption. For instance, the fact that younger individuals and those with higher education levels are more likely to use ChatGPT may indicate a shift in how knowledge and skills are disseminated, potentially widening the gap between tech-savvy populations and those who may lack access to both education and technology. This can lead to disparities in economic opportunities and social mobility.

The characteristics of early adopters also influence the speed and manner in which various groups integrate AI technologies into their daily lives. Individuals who are younger and more educated may have greater familiarity with technology, enabling quicker adaptation and integration of AI into their routines. In contrast, demographics with less access to education or technological resources may face barriers to adoption, slowing their integration of AI technologies. The observed trends suggest that as AI tools like ChatGPT become more ubiquitous and user-friendly, broader segments of the population may begin to adopt these technologies, albeit at different rates influenced by existing demographic factors. 

In summary, the early adoption characteristics of ChatGPT reflect familiar patterns observed in other technological innovations, with the additional nuance of significant growth in lower-income regions. These factors are critical for understanding the societal impacts of AI adoption and the varying degrees of integration across different demographics.","How People Use ChatGPT

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

By July 2025, approximately 700 million users were sending around 2.5 billion messages per day, representing a rapid and unprecedented global diffusion of technology, with about 10% of the global adult population actively engaging with the platform.

The introduction of ChatGPT has accelerated interest in LLM capabilities and their potential impacts on various sectors, including economic growth, employment, and societal interactions. The rapid adoption of this technology has led to increased exploration of its implications across these areas, highlighting the transformative power of AI in everyday life.

In terms of societal communication patterns, the data indicates that a significant portion of ChatGPT's usage, approximately 70%, is related to non-work activities. This suggests a shift in how individuals communicate, with people increasingly turning to AI for personal inquiries, entertainment, and informal interactions, rather than solely for professional or work-related tasks. The growth in non-work-related queries, which have outpaced work-related ones, points to a broader integration of AI into daily communication practices.

The widespread adoption of ChatGPT also raises various ethical considerations. As AI becomes more entrenched in communication, concerns regarding privacy, misinformation, and the potential for over-reliance on technology become paramount. The paper notes that no user messages were observed by humans in their analysis, which reflects an effort to address privacy issues, but broader ethical implications regarding data use and AI's role in shaping human interactions remain critical discussions within the field.

In conclusion, ChatGPT's launch has brought forth significant changes in AI and NLP, leading to rapid adoption and altering communication patterns among users. The increasing integration of such technologies into personal and societal communication raises essential ethical considerations that must be addressed as AI continues to evolve and permeate various aspects of life.","1

Additionally, analyze how this volume of communication might impact user engagement and the overall effectiveness of AI interactions, considering the implications for future AI development and user experience. How does this compare to messaging trends from previous years, and what can be inferred about the evolving relationship between users and AI technology?",How many messages were being sent each week by ChatGPT users by July 2025?,"By July 2025, users of ChatGPT were sending approximately 18 billion messages each week, which is a significant figure representing around 10% of the global adult population. The context indicates that messaging has been growing continuously, with non-work-related messages increasing at a faster rate than work-related messages. By this time, non-work messages accounted for more than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages.

Several factors contributed to the observed trends in messaging frequency. Firstly, the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and generative AI technologies since its launch in November 2022 has likely led to an increase in user engagement and exploration of the platform. The classification of messages indicates a shift in user behavior, where the majority of interactions are now focused on non-work-related topics. This change is attributed to evolving usage patterns within existing user cohorts rather than a change in the composition of new users.

The implications of this high volume of communication for user engagement and the effectiveness of AI interactions are significant. The increase in non-work-related queries suggests that users are finding diverse and possibly more personal applications for ChatGPT, which may enhance user satisfaction and engagement. This trend indicates a growing reliance on AI for various aspects of daily life outside of traditional work contexts, hinting at a deeper integration of AI into personal routines.

Furthermore, the substantial consumer surplus estimated at $97 billion in 2024 underscores the economic value users derive from AI interactions, suggesting that effective and engaging AI communication can lead to increased user loyalty and ongoing interaction with the technology. As user engagement grows, developers may focus on enhancing the conversational abilities of AI, tailoring experiences to user preferences, and addressing non-work-related inquiries more comprehensively.

In comparison to messaging trends from previous years, the rapid increase in both the number of messages and the shift toward non-work-related content indicates an evolving relationship between users and AI technology. This evolution suggests that as AI capabilities improve, users are increasingly willing to engage with AI for a broader range of purposes, indicating an expanding role for AI in everyday life.

In summary, by July 2025, ChatGPT users were sending 18 billion messages weekly, with a notable shift toward non-work-related queries. This trend reflects changing user engagement and highlights the potential for future AI development to focus on enhancing user experience across diverse applications.","messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more
than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its
impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a
similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to
changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT
users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to
uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $97 billion
in 2024 alone in the US.

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported"

How does the percentage of ChatGPT users reflect broader trends in technology adoption and digital literacy across different regions and demographics? Evaluate the potential implications of this user base on societal communication patterns and the evolution of professional industries. In your analysis, consider how these dynamics may influence future developments in AI technology and public perception of AI tools. Additionally, compare the percentage of ChatGPT users to that of other popular digital platforms and discuss what this reveals about user engagement and reliance on AI-driven solutions in contemporary society.",What percentage of the global adult population does the 700 million ChatGPT users represent?,"As of July 2025, approximately 700 million ChatGPT users represent nearly 10% of the estimated global adult population of around 5 billion. This percentage indicates a significant level of adoption of AI-driven tools like ChatGPT, reflecting broader trends in technology adoption and digital literacy across various regions and demographics.

The rapid growth of ChatGPT from 1 million users shortly after its launch in November 2022 to 700 million users within two years illustrates a remarkable acceptance and integration of artificial intelligence into daily life. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger demographics, with nearly half of all messages sent by users under the age of 26, and a notable reduction in gender gaps in usage, as more than half of users now have typically female first names. 

The increased usage of ChatGPT in low- and middle-income countries also suggests that access to technology is becoming more widespread, highlighting a shift toward greater digital literacy across diverse populations. Users with higher education and those in professional occupations tend to utilize ChatGPT more for work-related tasks, indicating that AI tools are becoming integral to professional communication and productivity.

The implications of such a large user base on societal communication patterns are profound. As more individuals and professionals adopt AI tools for communication and task management, we can expect shifts in how information is shared and processed. Industries reliant on traditional communication methods may evolve to accommodate AI-enhanced workflows, potentially increasing efficiency but also raising concerns about data privacy and the authenticity of AI-generated content.

Furthermore, the widespread adoption of ChatGPT may influence the evolution of AI technology itself. As user feedback and behavior are analyzed, developers may refine algorithms to better meet user needs, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. Public perception of AI tools is likely to evolve in tandem with this growth; while initial skepticism may persist, increased familiarity and utility could foster greater acceptance and reliance on AI solutions.

When comparing ChatGPT's user base to other popular digital platforms, such as social media sites or messaging apps, the engagement levels with AI-driven solutions like ChatGPT can indicate a shift in how individuals choose to interact with technology. While social media platforms have historically dominated user engagement metrics, the rapid adoption of ChatGPT suggests a growing reliance on tools that enhance productivity and facilitate information retrieval, marking a potential transition in user priorities from social interaction to efficiency and support in tasks.

Overall, the percentage of ChatGPT users, when contextualized within the broader landscape of technology adoption, reflects significant advancements in digital literacy and highlights the potential for AI-driven solutions to reshape communication practices and professional industries in the coming years.","Other papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant
precedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-
ple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.

The Growth of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December
5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active
users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after
one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than
700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population.20
Figure 3:

(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown
faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that
measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.
Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,
more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages
sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially
fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly
educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related
messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work.
Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

Name Analysis"
efc974b6-7597-468d-9009-4e01201d4518,reasoning,"How does the underlying technology of ChatGPT, specifically its architecture and training methodologies, compare to other AI models in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in natural language processing, and what implications do these differences have for the future development of conversational AI systems in various industries?",What type of technology is ChatGPT based on?,"The underlying technology of ChatGPT, primarily its architecture as a large language model (LLM) and its training methodologies, exhibits notable differences in efficiency and effectiveness compared to other AI models in the realm of natural language processing (NLP). These differences have significant implications for the future development of conversational AI systems across various industries.

1. **Architecture and Training Methodology**: ChatGPT is built on advanced versions of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture. This architecture allows it to generate contextually relevant responses by leveraging vast amounts of training data. The iterative training process involves fine-tuning the model on diverse datasets, which enhances its ability to understand and produce human-like text. Compared to traditional AI models, which may rely on rule-based systems or simpler machine learning techniques, ChatGPT's architecture allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in conversation.

2. **Efficiency and Effectiveness**: ChatGPT's efficiency is reflected in its ability to generate high-quality responses quickly, making it suitable for real-time interactions. The model's effectiveness is evidenced by user satisfaction ratings and its performance in providing tailored responses. Unlike standard web search engines, which return a list of links, ChatGPT provides customized responses, thus enhancing user experience. This customization is particularly beneficial for knowledge-intensive jobs, where improved decision support can boost productivity.

3. **Implications for Future Development**: The distinctions in ChatGPT's architecture and training methodologies suggest that future conversational AI systems will likely focus on enhancing personalization, real-time interaction, and decision support capabilities. Industries such as healthcare, finance, and education can particularly benefit from AI systems that serve as co-pilots or collaborators, improving the quality of decision-making and operational efficiency. As organizations increasingly integrate conversational AI into their workflows, the demand for models that prioritize user satisfaction and tailored interactions will grow.

In summary, while ChatGPT's architecture and training methodologies position it as a leader in NLP efficiency and effectiveness, these attributes also pave the way for future innovations in conversational AI, emphasizing personalized user experiences and enhanced productivity across various sectors.","Doing, and that Asking messages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier
that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.
How does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that
ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in
knowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et
al., 2023). This explains why Asking is relatively more common for educated users who are employed
in highly-paid, professional occupations.
Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas
(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either as co-workers that produce output or
as co-pilots that give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.

What is ChatGPT?
Here we give a simplified overview of LLMs and chatbots. For more precise details, refer to the papers

and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A
chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

distinguishes generative AI from existing technologies.
ChatGPT is also more flexible than web
search even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because
users receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy
football team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided
content and follow-up requests.

How might this focus influence the development of future AI technologies, and what are the broader societal implications of these changes in consumer behavior? Additionally, compare this focus with historical trends in technology adoption to evaluate potential long-term consequences for both users and developers.",What is one of the key focuses of the paper regarding consumer usage of ChatGPT?,"The paper on consumer usage of ChatGPT reveals significant insights into current user behaviors and suggests potential shifts in consumer expectations for AI interactions. The finding that over 70% of ChatGPT queries are unrelated to work indicates a marked preference for personal, informal, or leisure uses of the AI, which reflects a broader trend in how consumers are beginning to integrate AI technologies into their daily lives. This shift implies that consumers are increasingly seeking AI not just for productivity or professional tasks but also for entertainment, social interaction, and personal assistance.

### Implications for Future AI Development

1. **User-Centric Design**: The growing preference for non-work-related interactions suggests that future AI technologies may need to be designed with a greater focus on personal utility and user engagement rather than solely professional applications. Developers might prioritize features that enhance conversational quality, emotional intelligence, and personalized experiences over traditional work-related functionalities.

2. **Diverse Applications**: As consumer expectations evolve, there could be an expansion in the applications of AI technologies. For instance, developers may explore areas such as mental health support, creative writing assistance, and personalized learning experiences, addressing a wider range of consumer needs.

3. **Interactive Features**: The demand for more engaging AI interactions could lead to the incorporation of richer multimedia elements, such as voice and visual components, to make interactions more immersive.

### Broader Societal Implications

The changes in consumer behavior towards ChatGPT point to a potential cultural shift in how technology is perceived and utilized. As AI becomes more embedded in everyday life, we may see:

- **Normalization of AI**: The widespread adoption of conversational AI for non-work purposes could lead to a normalization of AI presence in daily activities, influencing everything from social interactions to leisure activities.

- **Privacy Concerns**: Increased usage of AI for personal queries may also raise concerns about privacy and data security, prompting a demand for better transparency and control over personal data.

- **Digital Divide**: The rapid adoption in lower-income countries highlights both opportunities and challenges in access to technology. Efforts must be made to ensure that the benefits of AI are equitably distributed across different socioeconomic groups.

### Comparison with Historical Trends in Technology Adoption

Historically, the adoption of transformative technologies often follows a pattern of initial use in professional settings before spilling over into consumer domains (e.g., computers, smartphones). The current trend of rapid adoption of ChatGPT for non-work-related uses suggests a potential acceleration of this pattern, where technology may leap directly into personal applications rather than following a slower, more traditional path. 

### Long-Term Consequences

For users, this trend could lead to greater reliance on AI for various aspects of life, potentially enhancing convenience but also raising questions about autonomy and decision-making. For developers, the necessity to adapt to evolving user expectations may necessitate more agile and innovative approaches to technology design.

In summary, the identified focus on non-work-related usage of ChatGPT not only reflects current consumer behaviors but also signals a shift in expectations that could shape the future landscape of AI technology and its integration into society. The implications of these changes are multifaceted, affecting individual users, developers, and the broader socio-economic context.","7

Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more"
