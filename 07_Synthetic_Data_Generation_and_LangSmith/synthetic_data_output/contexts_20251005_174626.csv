messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more 
common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by 
conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are 
the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. 
Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported

during the automated analysis. In a secure data clean room, we relate taxonomies of messages to
aggregated employment and education categories.

Two of our findings stand in contrast to other work. First, we find the share of messages related
to computer coding is relatively small: only 4.2% of ChatGPT messages are related to computer
programming, compared to 33% of work-related Claude conversations Handa et al. (2025).8 Second, we
find the share of messages related to companionship or social-emotional issues is fairly small: only 1.9%
of ChatGPT messages are on the topic of Relationships and Personal Reflection and 0.4% are related
7The difference between Practical Guidance and Seeking Information is that the former is highly customized to the
user and can be adapted based on conversation and follow-up, whereas the latter is factual information that should be
the same for all users. For example, users interested in running might ask ChatGPT for the Boston Marathon qualifying

derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into
three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Practical
Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to
advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation.7 Seeking Information includes searching for
information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub-
stitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other
communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user.
Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average
in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing,
critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages

common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by 
conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are 
the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. 
Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital 
outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both 
represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value

similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to
changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT

We introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is
seeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11
Asking is when the
user is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving
models of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and
Schneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output
or perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.
(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or
action. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.

the most prevalent use case for generative AI.9
We also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,
we show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,
and may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active
users had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,
with active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that
nearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps
have narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively
faster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and

are highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting
Information and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in
nearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales
occupations.

Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free,

Messages from the user to chatbot are classified
automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work,
the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET
task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to
classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A

related conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all
white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by
employers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of
generative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs
such as writing and software code.

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported

to Games and Role Play. In contrast, Zao-Sanders (2025) estimates that Therapy/Companionship is
the most prevalent use case for generative AI.9
We also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,
we show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,
and may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active
users had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,
with active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that
nearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps
have narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively
faster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and",1.0,"['data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf']",{}

three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Practical
Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to
advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation.7 Seeking Information includes searching for
information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub-
stitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other
communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user.
Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average
in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing,
critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages

conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are 
the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations.

outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both

is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported
adoption of LLMs (Bick et al., 2024; Pew Research Center, 2025); however there are reasons to expect
bias in self-reports (Ling and Imas, 2025), and none of these papers have been able to directly track
the quantity or nature of chatbot conversations.
Two recent papers do report statistics on chatbot conversations, classified in a variety of ways
(Handa et al., 2025; Tomlinson et al., 2025). We build on this work in several respects. First, the pool
of users on ChatGPT is far larger, meaning we expect our data to be a closer approximation to the
average chatbot user.4 Second, we use automated classifiers to report on the types of messages that
users send using new classification taxonomies relative to the existing literature. Third, we report the
diffusion of chatbot use across populations and the growth of different types of usage within cohorts.",1.0,"['data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf']",{}

Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

and thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage
are highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting
Information and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in
nearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales
occupations.
Overall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT
use cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is
either Practical Guidance or Seeking Information. We also show that Asking is growing faster than

We introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is
seeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11
Asking is when the
user is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving
models of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and
Schneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output
or perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.
(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or
action. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.
However, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing

messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more
than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its
impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a
similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to
changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT

derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into

Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education
categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages
sent by different groups while protecting user privacy.
Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free,
Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025.5
Messages from the user to chatbot are classified
automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work,
the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET
task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to
classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A

messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more 
common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by 
conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are 
the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. 
Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital 
outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both 
represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value 
through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.

derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into
three broad categories, which we call Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing. Practical
Guidance is the most common use case and includes activities like tutoring and teaching, how-to
advice about a variety of topics, and creative ideation.7 Seeking Information includes searching for
information about people, current events, products, and recipes, and appears to be a very close sub-
stitute for web search. Writing includes the automated production of emails, documents and other
communications, but also editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating text provided by the user.
Writing is the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average
in June 2025. About two-thirds of all Writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify user text (editing,
critiquing, translating, etc.) rather than creating new text from scratch. About 10% of all messages

job tasks), and nearly three-quarters of those are Writing tasks. The relative frequency of writing-
related conversations is notable for two reasons. First, writing is a task that is common to nearly all
white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top “soft” skills demanded by
employers (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2024). Second, one distinctive feature of
generative AI, relative to other information technologies, is its ability to produce long-form outputs
such as writing and software code.
We also map message content to work activities using the Occupational Information Network
(O*NET), a survey of job characteristics supported by the U.S. Department of Labor. We find that
about 81% of work-related messages are associated with two broad work activities: 1) obtaining,
documenting, and interpreting information; and 2) making decisions, giving advice, solving problems,",1.0,"['data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf']",{}

We also document several important facts about demographic variation in ChatGPT usage. First,
we show evidence that the gender gap in ChatGPT usage has likely narrowed considerably over time,
and may have closed completely. In the few months after ChatGPT was released about 80% of active
users had typically masculine first names.10 However, that number declined to 48% as of June 2025,
with active users slightly more likely to have typically feminine first names. Second, we find that
nearly half of all messages sent by adults were sent by users under the age of 26, although age gaps
have narrowed somewhat in recent months. Third, we find that ChatGPT usage has grown relatively
faster in low- and middle-income countries over the last year. Fourth, we find that educated users and

document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

and thinking creatively. Additionally, we find that the work activities associated with ChatGPT usage
are highly similar across very different kinds of occupations. For example, the work activities Getting
Information and Making Decisions and Solving Problems are in the top five of message frequency in
nearly all occupations, ranging from management and business to STEM to administrative and sales
occupations.
Overall, we find that information-seeking and decision support are the most common ChatGPT
use cases in most jobs. This is consistent with the fact that almost half of all ChatGPT usage is
either Practical Guidance or Seeking Information. We also show that Asking is growing faster than

9b5cc9b0-8099-4413-ac6c-5017c566f2a8,"users in highly-paid professional occupations are substantially more likely to use ChatGPT for work.
We introduce a new taxonomy to classify messages according to the kind of output the user is
seeking, using a simple rubric that we call Asking, Doing, or Expressing.11
Asking is when the
user is seeking information or clarification to inform a decision, corresponding to problem-solving
models of knowledge work (e.g., Garicano (2000); Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006); Carnehl and
Schneider (2025); Ide and Talamas (2025)). Doing is when the user wants to produce some output
or perform a particular task, corresponding to classic task-based models of work (e.g., Autor et al.
(2003)). Expressing is when the user is expressing views or feelings but not seeking any information or
action. We estimate that about 49% of messages are Asking, 40% are Doing, and 11% are Expressing.
However, as of July 2025 about 56% of work-related messages are classified as Doing (e.g., performing

messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more
than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its
impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a
similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to
changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT
users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to
uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $97 billion
in 2024 alone in the US.

derstanding product usage (“conversation classifier”). Nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage falls into

Fourth, we use a secure data clean room protocol to analyze aggregated employment and education
categories for a sample of our users, lending new insights about differences in the types of messages
sent by different groups while protecting user privacy.
Our primary sample is a random selection of messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans (Free,
Plus, Pro) between May 2024 and June 2025.5
Messages from the user to chatbot are classified
automatically using a number of different taxonomies: whether the message is used for paid work,
the topic of conversation, and the type of interaction (asking, doing, or expressing), and the O*NET
task the user is performing. Each taxonomy is defined in a prompt passed to an LLM, allowing us to
classify messages without any human seeing them. We give the text of most prompts in Appendix A
along with details about how the prompts were validated in Appendix B.6 The classification pipeline is",1.0,"['data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf', 'data/howpeopleuseai.pdf']",{}
