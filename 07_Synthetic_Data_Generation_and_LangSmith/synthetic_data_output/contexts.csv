ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.
All analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only
pre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or
export the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute
any query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a
committee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only
approved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).
Our partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting
a threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever
visible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-"

Data and Privacy
In this section, we describe the data used in the paper and the privacy safeguards we implemented. No
member of the research team ever saw the content of user messages, and all analyses were conducted
in accordance with OpenAI’s Privacy Policy (OpenAI, 2025c).
The analysis in this paper is based on the following datasets:
1. Growth: total daily message volumes from consumer ChatGPT users between November 2022
and September 2025, along with basic self-reported demographic information. This dataset is
primarily used in Section 4.
2. Classified messages: messages classified into coarse categories.
• Sampled from all ChatGPT users: a random sample of approximately one million de-
identified messages from logged-in consumer ChatGPT users between May 2024 and June
2025.14 This dataset is primarily used in Section 5."

The Growth of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December
5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active
users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after
one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than
700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population.20

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported"

chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

Table 3: Coarse Conversation Topics and Underlying Classifier Categories
Figure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation
Topics are Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing, collectively accounting for about
77% of all ChatGPT conversations. Practical Guidance has remained constant at roughly 29% of
overall usage. Writing has declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later. Seeking
Information has grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share of Technical

queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.
Second, the three most common ChatGPT conversation topics are Practical Guidance, Writing,
and Seeking Information, collectively accounting for nearly 78% of all messages.
Computer Pro-
gramming and Relationships and Personal Reflection account for only 4.2% and 1.9% of messages
respectively.
Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages
overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About
two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text
from scratch.
Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we
call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,
advice, or information (Asking), 40% are requests to complete tasks that can be plugged into a process

Information has grown from 14% to 24% of all usage over the same period. The share of Technical
Help declined from 12% from all usage in July 2024 to around 5% a year later – this may be because
the use of LLMs for programming has grown very rapidly through the API (outside of ChatGPT),
for AI assistance in code editing and for autonomous programming agents (e.g. Codex). Multimedia
grew from 2% to just over 7%, with a large spike in April 2025 after ChatGPT released new image-
generation capabilities: the spike attenuated but the elevated level has persisted.
Figure 8 shows Conversation Topics, restricting the sample to only work-related messages. About
40% of all work-related messages in July 2025 are Writing, by far the most common Conversation
Topic. Practical Guidance is the second most common use case at 24%. Technical Help has declined
from 18% of all work-related messages in July 2024 to just over 10% in July 2025."
92bade2f-3ba7-4b04-b746-c053cc4f2a46,"Table 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however
non-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which
climbed to 73% by June 2025.
Figure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-
sive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work
use has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest
cohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.

Total daily counts are exact measurements of message volume from all consumer plans. Daily counts of work
and non-work related messages are estimated by classifying a random sample of conversations from that day.
Sampling is done to exclude users who opt-out of sharing their messages for model training, users who self-
report their age as under 18, logged-out users, deleted conversations, and accounts which have been deactivated
or banned (details available in Section 3). Reported values are 7-day averages (to smooth weekly fluctuation)

messages have grown continuously, but non-work messages have grown faster and now represent more

approximately 23% of messages for users under age 26, with this share increasing with age. The
one exception is users who self-attest to being 66 years-old or older, with only 16% of their classified
messages being work-related. The plot below shows trends in the share of work-related messages by
age group. ChatGPT usage has become less work-related over time for users of all ages.

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

the yellow and pink lines represents the messages sent by users who signed up in Q2 and Q3 of 2023.
There has been dramatic growth in message volume both by new cohorts of users, and from growth
in existing cohorts.
Figure 5 normalizes each cohort, plotting daily messages per weekly active user. Each line rep-
resents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that
earlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within
every cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,
and (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.

How ChatGPT is Used

snapshots every six months, November 2022–September 2025.
Figure 4 presents growth in the total messages sent by users over time. The solid line shows that
between July 2024 and July 2025, the number of messages sent grew by a factor of more than 5.
Figure 4 also shows the contribution of individual cohorts of users to aggregate message volume.
The yellow line represents the first cohort of ChatGPT users: their usage declined somewhat over
2023, but started growing again in late 2024 and is now higher than it has ever been. The pink line
represents messages from users who signed up in Q3 of 2023 or earlier, and so the difference between

Figure 20: Likelihood that a message is work related, conditioned on self-reported user age. Messages are
identified as work related using an automated classifier. As with our other samples (see Section 3), users who
self-report an age under 18 are excluded from analysis. Values are averaged over a 28 day lagging window.
Shares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024
through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day.

Variation by Country
We study global patterns of ChatGPT usage by measuring the proportion of weekly consumer Chat-
GPT users among the internet enabled population of countries with populations larger than 1 million.
We also exclude countries in which ChatGPT is blocked. The figure below plots this proportion in
May 2024 and May 2025 by GDP-per-capita deciles: countries are ranked by GDP-per-capita and split"

message shares on age, whether the name was typically masculine or feminine, education, occupation
categories, job seniority, firm size, and industry. We also include 95% confidence intervals for the
regression-adjusted results.
Educated users are much more likely to use ChatGPT for work. 37% of messages are work-related
for users with less than a bachelor’s degree, compared to 46% for users with exactly a bachelor’s
degree and 48% for those with some graduate education. Those differences are cut roughly in half
after adjusting for other characteristics, but they are still statistically significant at the less than 1

(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown
faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that
measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.
Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,
more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages
sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially
fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly
educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related
messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work.
Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.

Other papers have analyzed digital behavior and demographic data; we mention a few relevant
precedents here. Humlum and Vestergaard (2025b) and Humlum and Vestergaard (2025a), for exam-
ple, analyze large-scale surveys on chatbot use along with Danish administrative labor market data.
Chetty et al. (2022) analyze de-identified Facebook friendship graphs and anonymized IRS tax records,
aggregated at the zip code level.

The Growth of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December
5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active
users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after
one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than
700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population.20
Figure 3:"
967d55e6-288c-4225-8fdd-d8fdabf03f3f,"and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A
chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

Doing, and that Asking messages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier
that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.
How does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that
ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in
knowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et
al., 2023). This explains why Asking is relatively more common for educated users who are employed
in highly-paid, professional occupations.
Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas
(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either as co-workers that produce output or
as co-pilots that give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.

What is ChatGPT?
Here we give a simplified overview of LLMs and chatbots. For more precise details, refer to the papers

Figure 6: The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to
work, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The
dotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used
ChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with
coloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million
sampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total
message volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.

What are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?

the user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one"

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

Figure 7 shows the composition of user messages over time. The three most common Conversation
Topics are Practical Guidance, Seeking Information, and Writing, collectively accounting for about
77% of all ChatGPT conversations. Practical Guidance has remained constant at roughly 29% of
overall usage. Writing has declined from 36% of all usage in July 2024 to 24% a year later. Seeking

Computer Pro-

respectively.
Third, Writing is by far the most common work use, accounting for 42% of work-related messages
overall and more than half of all messages for users in management and business occupations. About
two-thirds of Writing messages are requests to modify user text rather than to produce novel text
from scratch.
Fourth, we classify messages according to the kind of output users are seeking with a rubric we
call Asking, Doing, or Expressing. About 49% of messages are users asking ChatGPT for guidance,

ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

resents an individual cohort (instead of a cumulative cohort, as in Figure 4). The figure shows that
earlier sign-ups have consistently had higher usage, but that usage has also consistently grown within
every cohort, which we interpret as due to both (1) improvements in the capabilities of the models,
and (2) users slowly discovering new uses for existing capabilities.

The Growth of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December
5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active
users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after
one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than
700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population.20

chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

Doing, and that Asking messages are consistently rated as having higher quality both by a classifier
that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.
How does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that
ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in
knowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et
al., 2023). This explains why Asking is relatively more common for educated users who are employed
in highly-paid, professional occupations.
Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas
(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either as co-workers that produce output or
as co-pilots that give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.

distinguishes generative AI from existing technologies.
ChatGPT is also more flexible than web
search even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because
users receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy
football team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided
content and follow-up requests.

Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.
The fact that non-work usage is increasing faster suggests that the welfare gains from generative AI
usage could be substantial. Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) estimate that US users would have to
be paid $98 to forgo using generative AI for a month, implying a surplus of at least $97 billion a
year. Within work usage, we find that users currently appear to derive value from using ChatGPT
as an advisor or research assistant, not just a technology that performs job tasks directly.

Privacy via a Data Clean Room.
We never directly accessed user-level demographic records.
All analysis of employment data was executed exclusively within a secure DCR that permits only
pre-approved aggregate computations across independently held datasets; neither party can view or
export the other party’s underlying records. We governed the DCR with strict protocols: To execute
any query that touched the external demographic data, we first obtained explicit sign-off from a
committee of 6 coauthors and then submitted the notebook to our data partner for approval; only
approved notebooks could run in the DCR (see Figure 2).
Our partner enforced strict aggregation limits: they only approved code that returned cells meeting
a threshold of 100 users. Consequently, no individual rows or narrowly defined categories were ever
visible to researchers. For example, if 99 users had the occupation “anesthesiologist,” any occupation-

employment data through a secure data clean room environment: no one on the research
team had direct access to user-level demographic data and none of our analyses report
aggregates for groups with less than 100 users.
In following these measures, we aim to match or exceed the privacy protection precedents set by
other social scientists studying chatbots and those linking digital platform data to external sources.
We follow the precedent established in recent analyses of chatbot conversations (Phang et al.
(2025), Eloundou et al. (2025), Handa et al. (2025), Tomlinson et al. (2025)) that rely on automated
classification rather than human inspection of raw transcripts. In particular, Phang et al. (2025)’s
study of affective use of ChatGPT and Eloundou et al. (2025) investigation of first-person fairness in
chatbots both analyze ChatGPT message content via automated classifiers and emphasize classifier-"

ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster."

ChatGPT is also more flexible than web
search even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because
users receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy
football team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided
content and follow-up requests.
Figure 9: Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3. The
underlying classifier prompt is available in Appendix A. Each bin reports a percentage of the total population.
Shares are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024
through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling
details available in Section 3.

User Intent

(Doing), and 1% are messages that have no clear intent (Expressing). Asking messages have grown
faster than Doing messages over the last year and are rated higher quality using both a classifier that
measures user satisfaction and direct user feedback.
Fifth, gender gaps in ChatGPT usage have likely closed substantially over time. As of July 2025,
more than half of weekly active users had typically female first names. Sixth, nearly half of all messages
sent by adults were from users under the age of 26. Seventh, ChatGPT usage has grown especially
fast over the last year in low- and middle-income countries. Eighth, we find that users who are highly
educated and working in professional occupations are more likely to use ChatGPT for work-related
messages and for Asking rather than Doing messages at work.
Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT has a broad-based impact on the global economy.

Figure 6: The solid black line represents the probability that a messages on a given day is not related to
work, as determined by an automated classifier. Values are averaged over a 28-day lagging window. The
dotted orange line shows the same calculation, but conditioned on messages being from users who first used
ChatGPT during or before Q2 of 2024. The remaining lines are defined similarly for successive quarters, with
coloring cooling for more recent cohorts. Counts are calculated from a sample of approximately 1.1 million
sampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to reflect total
message volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.
5.2
What are the topics of ChatGPT conversations?
We modify a classifier used by internal research teams at OpenAI that identifies which capabilities
the user is requesting from ChatGPT. The classifier itself directly assigns the user’s query into one"
c91c9c8a-72aa-4009-ba4e-5d8b09611e86,"Table 1 shows that both types of queries grew rapidly between June 2024 and June 2025, however
non-work-related messages grew faster: 53% of messages were not related to work in June 2024, which
climbed to 73% by June 2025.
Figure 6 plots the share of non-work messages decomposed by cumulative sign-up cohorts. Succes-
sive cohorts have had a higher share of non-work messages, but also within each cohort their non-work
use has increased. Comparing the share among all users (black line) to the share among the earliest
cohort of users (yellow line), we can see that they track very closely.

Figure 12 presents changes over time in the composition of messages by user intent.
In July
2024, usage was evenly split between Asking and Doing, with just under 8% of messages classified as
Expressing. Asking and Expressing grew much faster than Doing over the next year, and by late June
2025 the split was 51.6% Asking, 34.6% Doing, and 13.8% Expressing.
Figure 12: Shares of messages classified as Asking, Doing, or Expressing by an automated ternary classifier.
Values are averaged over a 28 day lagging window. Shares are calculated from a sample of approximately
1.1 million sampled conversations from May 15, 2024 through June 26, 2025. Observations are reweighted to
reflect total message volumes on a given day. Sampling details available in Section 3.
Figure 13 presents the share of work-related messages by user intent.
Doing messages, which
account for approximately 40% of messages, have an even split of messages between work-related and

Who Uses ChatGPT
In this section we report basic descriptive facts about who uses consumer ChatGPT. Existing work
documents variation in generative AI use by demographic groups within representative samples in
the U.S. (Bick et al. (2024), Hartley et al. (2025)) and within a subset of occupations in Denmark
(Humlum and Vestergaard, 2025a). All of these papers find that generative AI is used more frequently
by men, young people, and those with tertiary and/or graduate education.
We make three contributions relative to this prior literature. First, we confirm these broad demo-
graphic patterns in a global sample rather than a single country. Second, we provide more detail for
selected demographics such as age, gender, and country of origin and study how gaps in each have
changed over time. Third, we use a secure data clean room to analyze how ChatGPT usage varies by
education and occupation.

than 70% of all consumer ChatGPT messages. While most economic analysis of AI has focused on its
impact on productivity in paid work, the impact on activity outside of work (home production) is on a
similar scale and possibly larger. The decrease in the share of work-related messages is primarily due to
changing usage within each cohort of users rather than a change in the composition of new ChatGPT
users. This finding is consistent with Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025), who use choice experiments to
uncover willingness-to-pay for generative AI and estimate a consumer surplus of at least $97 billion
in 2024 alone in the US.

The Growth of ChatGPT
ChatGPT was released to the public on November 30, 2022 as a “research preview,” and by December
5 it had more than one million registered users. Figure 3 reports the growth of overall weekly active
users (WAU) on consumer plans over time. ChatGPT had more than 100 million logged-in WAU after
one year, and almost 350 million after two years. By the end of July 2025, ChatGPT had more than
700 million total WAU, nearly 10% of the world’s adult population.20

that measures user satisfaction and from direct user feedback.
How does ChatGPT provide economic value, and for whom is its value the greatest? We argue that
ChatGPT likely improves worker output by providing decision support, which is especially important in
knowledge-intensive jobs where better decision-making increases productivity (Deming, 2021; Caplin et
al., 2023). This explains why Asking is relatively more common for educated users who are employed
in highly-paid, professional occupations.
Our findings are most consistent with Ide and Talamas
(2025), who develop a model where AI agents can serve either as co-workers that produce output or
as co-pilots that give advice and improve the productivity of human problem-solving.

and system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A
chatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to
maximize the “quality” of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.
In a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (“prompt”) and ChatGPT
returns the message (“response”) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features
have been added to ChatGPT—including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external
databases, and generate images based on text—but the exchange of text-based messages remains the
most typical interaction.
Since its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model’s weights and
to the model’s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).

distinguishes generative AI from existing technologies.
ChatGPT is also more flexible than web
search even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because
users receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy
football team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided
content and follow-up requests.

Conclusion
This paper studies the rapid growth of ChatGPT, which launched in November 2022. By July 2025,
ChatGPT had been used weekly by more than 700 million users, who were collectively sending more
than 2.5 billion messages per day, or about 29,000 messages per second. Yet despite the rapid adop-
tion of ChatGPT and Generative AI more broadly, little previous evidence existed on how this new
technology is used and who is using it.
This is the first economics paper to use internal ChatGPT message data, and we do so while
introducing a novel privacy-preserving methodology.
No user messages were observed by humans
during any part of the work on this paper.
This paper documents eight important facts about ChatGPT. First, as of July 2025 about 70%
of ChatGPT consumer queries were unrelated to work; while both work-related and non-work-related
queries have been increasing, non-work queries have been increasing faster.

Introduction
ChatGPT launched in November 2022. By July 2025, 18 billion messages were being sent each week
by 700 million users, representing around 10% of the global adult population.1 For a new technology,
this speed of global diffusion has no precedent (Bick et al., 2024).
This paper studies consumer usage of ChatGPT, the first mass-market chatbot and likely the
largest.2 ChatGPT is based on a Large Language Model (LLM), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
developed over the last decade and generally considered to represent an acceleration in AI capabilities.3
The sudden growth in LLM abilities and adoption has intensified interest in the effects of artificial
intelligence on economic growth (Acemoglu, 2024; Korinek and Suh, 2024); employment (Eloundou
et al., 2025); and society (Kulveit et al., 2025). However, despite the rapid adoption of LLMs, there
is limited public information on how they are used. A number of surveys have measured self-reported

ABSTRACT
Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We 
document the growth of ChatGPT’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 
through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world’s adult population. 
Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and 
we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated 
pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. 
We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related 
messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more"
