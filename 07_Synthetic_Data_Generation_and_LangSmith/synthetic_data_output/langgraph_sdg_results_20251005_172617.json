For more precise details, refer to the papers\n\nand system cards that OpenAI has released with each model e.g., (OpenAI, 2023, 2024a, 2025b). A\nchatbot is a statistical model trained to generate a text response given some text input, so as to\nmaximize the \u201cquality\u201d of that response, where the quality is measured with a variety of metrics.\nIn a prototypical interaction, a user submits a plain-text message (\u201cprompt\u201d) and ChatGPT\nreturns the message (\u201cresponse\u201d) generated from an underlying LLM. A large set of additional features\nhave been added to ChatGPT\u2014including the possibility for the LLM to search the web or external\ndatabases, and generate images based on text\u2014but the exchange of text-based messages remains the\nmost typical interaction.\nSince its launch ChatGPT has used a variety of different underlying LLMs e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-5.12 In addition there are occasional updates to the model\u2019s weights and\nto the model\u2019s system prompt (text instructions sent to the model along with all the queries).\n\ndistinguishes generative AI from existing technologies.\nChatGPT is also more flexible than web\nsearch even for traditional applications like Seeking Information and Practical Guidance, because\nusers receive customized responses (e.g., tailored workout plans, new product ideas, ideas for fantasy\nfootball team names) that represent newly generated content or novel modification of user-provided\ncontent and follow-up requests.\nFigure 9: Breakdown of granular conversation topic shares within the coarse mapping defined in Table 3.
