Plus, the economic spike is jaw-dropping: users literally value AI so much they’d shell out $98 monthly to NOT lose it—hello, that’s a consumer surplus north of $97 billion yearly in the US alone.\\n\\nIn essence, the money magic happens because AI is the ultimate decision-support wingman, turbocharging work output in *knowledge-intensive* arenas.
