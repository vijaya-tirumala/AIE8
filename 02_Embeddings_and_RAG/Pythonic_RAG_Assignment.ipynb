        "The core difference is that sync processes one request at a time (waiting for each to complete), while async processes multiple requests concurrently without waiting. Key benefits of async for embedding collection include: \n",
        "(1) Performance - concurrent processing of multiple embedding requests significantly reduces total time (e.g., 100 documents: 50s → 5s)\n",
        "(2) Efficiency - parallel API calls instead of sequential blocking, better resource utilization, and lower costs\n",
        "(3) User Experience - faster response times, non-blocking operations, and responsive UI\n",
        "(4) Scalability - handles large document collections efficiently while maintaining performance as datasets grow. \n",
        "\n",
        "Async is particularly powerful for embedding generation because it's I/O-bound (waiting for API responses), multiple requests are independent (can run in parallel), and large datasets benefit significantly from concurrent processing. This makes async essential for production RAG systems, transforming slow sequential processes into fast concurrent ones."

            "The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO or startup founder, who originally came from a particular function within the company (such as product management, sales, or marketing), hires a weak executive into that same function. This often happens because the CEO struggles to let go of the function that was instrumental in bringing them to their leadership position, and by hiring a weak executive, they can continue to remain the dominant figure in that area rather than delegating real control. The problem is illustrated by the example of Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney, who had been a brilliant TV network executive but when he bought ABC, the network fell to fourth place. Eisner wanted to personally turn ABC around but did not have the time, highlighting the difficulty of weak executive leadership in a critical role. \n",
