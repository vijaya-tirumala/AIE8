    "Structured response templates are important because they make agent outputs predictable and machine-readable, which allows other parts of the system to use the data without extra parsing. They enable smooth chaining between agents in a workflow, since each step receives data in a known format. Using schemas like Pydantic also improves error handling by validating outputs automatically. This reduces ambiguity, increases reliability, and helps keep the entire agentic pipeline more efficient and scalable.\n"

      "\n",
      "### 3. Marketing Dashboards\n",
      "\n",
      "**Purpose:** Marketing dashboards enable teams to track the effectiveness of campaigns, understand customer engagement, and optimize marketing spend.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts and Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of the SDK are **agents**—intelligent entities that encapsulate a specific set of instructions and tools. Each agent is built on top of a large language model and can be customized with its own personality, domain expertise, and operational directives. For example, a \"Math Tutor\" agent could be designed to solve math problems by explaining each step clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key elements of an agent include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instructions:** Specific guidelines that shape the agent's responses and behavior in the context of its designated role.\n",
    "- **Tools:** Predefined or dynamically integrated tools that the agent can leverage to access external resources (e.g., web search or file search functionalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique feature introduced by the SDK is the concept of **handoffs**. Handoffs allow agents to delegate tasks to one another based on expertise and contextual needs. This orchestration paves the way for sophisticated workflows where multiple agents work in tandem, each contributing its specialized capabilities to complete a complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety and reliability remain a cornerstone in AI development, and the SDK introduces **guardrails** as a means of controlling input and output validation. Guardrails help ensure that agents operate within defined safety parameters, preventing unintended actions and mitigating risks associated with autonomous decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Debugging and Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "The development process is further enhanced by built-in **tracing and visualization tools**. These tools offer real-time insights into agent interactions, tool invocations, and decision-making pathways, thereby making debugging and optimization more accessible and systematic. The tracing functionality is a vital feature for developers looking to fine-tune agent performance in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture and Developer Experience\n",
    "\n",
