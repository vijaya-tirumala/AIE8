# SolvIQ Problem Analysis System PRD

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2023-10-01  
**Last Updated:** 2023-10-01

## Project Overview

The comprehensive problem analysis system for SolvIQ accepts user-submitted problems in various formats, analyzes and breaks them into manageable components, identifies key concepts, and suggests problem-solving approaches. It provides real-time feedback and stores results for continuous learning and reference.

## Business Objectives

- Enhance user engagement through advanced problem-solving capabilities.
- Showcase AI-driven analysis for AIE Certification.
- Increase user base through effective problem-solving strategies.

## Target Audience

Students, professionals, and lifelong learners.

## User Stories

### 1. Problem Submission

**Description:** As a user, I want to submit problems in various formats so that I can receive AI-driven analysis.

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 5

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can upload problems in text, image, or document formats.
- Submitted problems are acknowledged with a confirmation.

### 2. Problem Breakdown

**Description:** As a user, I want the system to break down complex problems into manageable parts so that I can understand them better.

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System identifies and lists components of complex problems.
- Users receive a visual representation of problem components.

### 3. Concept Identification

**Description:** As a user, I want the system to identify key concepts and constraints so that I can focus on critical aspects of the problem.

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 5

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Key concepts are highlighted in the analysis.
- Constraints are listed with explanations.

### 4. Solutions Suggestion

**Description:** As a user, I want the system to suggest methodologies for solving problems so that I can choose effective strategies.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 8

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System suggests at least three different problem-solving methodologies.
- Each suggestion includes a brief description.

### 5. Real-Time Feedback

**Description:** As a user, I want to receive real-time feedback during problem analysis so that I can adjust my approach if needed.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 8

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Feedback is given within 5 seconds of analysis.
- Hints are relevant and improve understanding.

### 6. Result Storage

**Description:** As a user, I want my analysis results to be stored for future reference so that I can track my progress.

**Priority:** Low  
**Story Points:** 3

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All analysis results are accessible from a personal dashboard.
- Results can be flagged for review or reference.

## Technical Requirements

### Problem Submission Module

**Requirements:**
- Support for file uploads (text, images, documents)

**Constraints:**
- Max file size of 10MB

**Dependencies:**
- File upload libraries

**Performance Metrics:**
- Uploads processed within 3 seconds

### Problem Analysis Engine

**Requirements:**
- Use GPT models for text analysis
- Use vector databases to store concepts

**Constraints:**
- Real-time processing under 1 second response time

**Dependencies:**
- OpenAI API, Vector databases

**Performance Metrics:**
- Analyze problems with 95% accuracy

### Feedback System

**Requirements:**
- Provide real-time hints using AI models

**Constraints:**
- Response time under 500ms

**Dependencies:**
- Redis for caching feedback results

**Performance Metrics:**
- 98% satisfied feedback rate

## System Architecture

The architecture consists of a frontend using React/Next.js for user interactions, a backend using Python/FastAPI for processing, and integrates GPT models for problem analysis. Data is stored in PostgreSQL and cached using Redis for efficient performance.

## User Flow

Users submit a problem through the interface, where it is processed by the backend. The system analyzes and breaks down the problem, provides real-time feedback, and stores the results for user access.

## Success Metrics

- 90% user satisfaction with problem analysis.
- 85% accuracy in problem breakdown and concept identification.
- Increase in active user sessions by 50% after feature release.

## AIE Certification Goals

- Demonstrate multi-modal AI interactions.
- Prove scalability by maintaining performance with increased load.

## Demo Day Requirements

- Showcase problem submission and analysis in real-time.
- Demonstrate intelligent feedback capability using live examples.

## Development Timeline

Development to span 3 months with iterative testing phases every 2 weeks.

## Assumptions

- Users have internet access.
- Users understand the basic problem context when submitting.

## Identified Risks

- Potential privacy concerns over stored analysis data.
- High dependency on AI model accuracy.

## Cursor Development Rules

- Follow SOLID principles in coding.
- Ensure error handling for all user inputs.
- Maintain a responsive UI for the analysis module.
