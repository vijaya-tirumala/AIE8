# SolvIQ Authentication System PRD

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2023-10-01  
**Last Updated:** 2023-10-01

## Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the user authentication system within the SolvIQ platform. This system will enable secure login, registration, and password reset functionalities. The objective is to provide a seamless and secure experience for users accessing the AI-powered problem-solving features of SolvIQ.

## Business Objectives

- Ensure secure access to SolvIQ features
- Improve user experience with streamlined authentication processes
- Support AIE Certification by implementing advanced and secure user management
- Facilitate data-driven insights into user access patterns

## Target Audience

Students, professionals, and lifelong learners seeking to improve their problem-solving skills

## User Stories

### 1. User Login

**Description:** As a user, I want to log in securely so that I can access the platform's features.

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 3

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can log in with email and password.
- Successful login redirects the user to the dashboard.
- User receives an error message for incorrect credentials.
- User sees a loading state during authentication.

### 2. User Registration

**Description:** As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can start using SolvIQ.

**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 5

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can register using email and a secure password.
- Password must meet complexity requirements.
- User receives a confirmation email upon successful registration.
- User can log in immediately after registration.

### 3. Password Reset

**Description:** As an existing user, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 4

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can request a password reset via email.
- User receives an email with a secure reset link.
- User can set a new password through the reset link.
- User is notified of successful password change.
- Reset link expires after a specified timeframe.

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication System

**Requirements:**
- Implement secure login, registration, and password reset interfaces.
- Use JWT for token-based authentication.
- Encrypt passwords with a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- Validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Use rate limiting for login and password reset requests to prevent abuse.

**Constraints:**
- Must adhere to GDPR and other relevant regulations.
- Ensure compatibility with existing tech stack (Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL).

**Dependencies:**
- Email service for sending confirmation and reset emails.
- Redis for session management.

**Performance Metrics:**
- Authenticate within 500ms majority of the time.
- Support at least 1000 concurrent sessions.

## System Architecture

The authentication system will interface with the FastAPI backend to handle user data and session management. JWTs will be used for secure stateless sessions. Password data will be stored securely in PostgreSQL using hashed formats. The frontend in React/Next.js will manage user interactions for all authentication workflows.

## User Flow

Users initiate authentication via the frontend. For registration, users submit their details which are stored securely. Logging in involves verifying credentials against those on record. Password resets generate a secure token sent via email, which users use to set a new password.

## Success Metrics

- 100% compliance with security best practices
- Achieving a 4.5+ user satisfaction score regarding login/registration experience
- 99.9% uptime for authentication services
- Zero successful unauthorized access instances

## AIE Certification Goals

- Showcase secure AI-driven decision making for user permission management.
- Demonstrate the orchestration of AI agents for security threat detection.

## Demo Day Requirements

- Live demonstration of the authentication process with security highlights.
- Showcase integration with AI models for multi-modal interactions.

## Development Timeline

2 weeks for initial development, 1 week for testing and security auditing, 1 week for adjustments based on testing feedback.

## Assumptions

- Users have access to their registered email accounts.
- Users are familiar with standard authentication processes.

## Identified Risks

- Potential security vulnerabilities such as brute force attacks.
- System downtime impacts user access.
- Email delivery issues affecting account confirmation and password resets.

## Cursor Development Rules

Implement tests for all user flows to ensure comprehensive coverage. All code should pass security audits and adhere to the defined constraints and dependencies. Follow agile practices for development and integrate security reviews into the cycle.
