    "\n",
    "**Embedding Caching:**\n",
    "The process of embedding is typically very time consuming and expensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Send text to OpenAI API endpoint\n",
    "2. Wait for processing  \n",
    "3. Receive response\n",
    "4. Pay for API call\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs *every single time* a document gets converted into a vector representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Caching Solution:**\n",
    "1. Check local cache for previously computed embeddings\n",
    "2. If found: Return cached vector (instant, free)\n",
    "3. If not found: Call OpenAI API, store result in cache\n",
    "4. Return vector representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Response Caching:**\n",
    "Similarly, we cache LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls for identical prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- ⚡ Faster response times (cache hits are instant)\n",

    "**1. Memory vs Disk Caching Trade-offs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Limitation:*** Fast and free but lost on restart, limited by RAM\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Cache Invalidation Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Limitation:*** No automatic invalidation - caches persist indefinitely. A version/time based, even-driven invalidation will be helpful to retrieve always fresh data\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Concurrent Access Patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Limitation:*** Can lead to racing patterns between the threads, particularly for writes\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Cache Size Management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Limitation:*** With no cache size defined, it can grow unbounded consuming disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Cold Start Scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Limitation:*** Slow for first users who try afte deployment may experience poor results\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is most useful for legal, health care industry where the documentation is stable and exact match may be required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is least useful when realtime data is required in which case cache consistency is required across the systems.\n"

    "##### ✅ Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. When would you choose each agent type?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Simple Agent offers fast, low-cost, and low-latency responses with a straightforward architecture that’s easy to debug and maintain, making it ideal for high-throughput scenarios. Direct tool → agent → response flow without additional evaluation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it lacks quality assurance and self-correction, leading to higher error rates and inconsistent responses. It’s best suited for real-time chat, high-volume queries, cost-sensitive applications, or simple Q&A systems where speed and efficiency are prioritized over accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Helpfulness Agent prioritizes high-quality, consistent, and accurate responses through self-evaluation and iterative refinement, catching errors before delivering answers and improving the user experience. While it reduces mistakes and ensures reliability, it comes with higher latency, and also additional cost due to extra LLM calls. It’s best suited for critical, quality-sensitive, or customer-facing applications, as well as tasks like document analysis where accuracy is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Production Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpfulness checks take additional time per refinement, which can stack over multiple cycles, so it’s best to cap refinements, use faster models, cache evaluation results, and skip checks for simple queries. Costs are also higher than a simple agent. So caching, evaluating only complex queries, and setting budget limits can help. For monitoring, track response time, cost, refinement iterations, error rates, and user satisfaction, using tools like LangSmith and dashboards, with alerts for latency spikes, excessive loops, or high costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scalability Questions:**\n",
    "Simple agents handle high load easily and scale well, while helpfulness agents use more resources and can hit API limits. Caching speeds things up LLM responses, embeddings, and tool results for simple agents, plus evaluation results and refinements for helpfulness agents. Rate limiting and circuit breakers prevent overload and failures, with fallbacks to simpler agents if needed.  \n",

    "## Task 4: Guardrails Integration for Production Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll integrate **Guardrails AI** into our production system to ensure our agents operate safely and within acceptable boundaries. Guardrails provide essential safety layers for production LLM applications by validating inputs, outputs, and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ What are Guardrails?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are specialized validation systems that help \"catch\" when LLM interactions go outside desired parameters. They operate both **pre-generation** (input validation) and **post-generation** (output validation) to ensure safe, compliant, and on-topic responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Categories:**\n",
    "- **Topic Restriction**: Ensure conversations stay on-topic\n",
    "- **PII Protection**: Detect and redact sensitive information  \n",
    "- **Content Moderation**: Filter inappropriate language/content\n",
    "- **Factuality Checks**: Validate responses against source material\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Detection**: Prevent adversarial prompt attacks\n",
    "- **Competitor Monitoring**: Avoid mentioning competitors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benefits of Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏢 Enterprise Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for data protection\n",
    "- **Brand Safety**: Maintain consistent, appropriate communication tone\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce liability from inappropriate AI responses\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure factual accuracy and relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚡ Technical Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Layered Defense**: Multiple validation stages for robust protection\n",
    "- **Selective Enforcement**: Different guards for different use cases\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Fast validation without sacrificing accuracy\n",
    "- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with LangGraph agent workflows\n"

    "\n",
    "**Your Mission**: Enhance the existing LangGraph agent by adding a **Guardrails validation node** that ensures all interactions are safe, on-topic, and compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
    "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
    "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
    "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
    "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
    "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
    "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
    "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
    "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
    "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
    "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
    "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
    "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
    "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
    "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
    "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
    "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
    "- Consider guard performance vs security trade-offs\n"
