    "1. **User Clarification** - Optionally asks clarifying questions to understand the research scope\n",
    "2. **Research Brief Generation** - Transforms user messages into a structured research brief\n",

       "# Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT Usage Patterns: NBER Working Paper No. 34255\n",
       "\n",
       "## Executive Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "The NBER Working Paper \"How People Use ChatGPT\" by Aaron Chatterji and colleagues represents the most comprehensive analysis to date of how people interact with AI chatbots. The study tracked ChatGPT usage from its November 2022 launch through July 2025, revealing unprecedented adoption rates, significant demographic shifts, and evolving usage patterns that challenge conventional assumptions about AI adoption and application.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Main Findings About AI Usage\n",
       "\n",
       "### Unprecedented Growth and Adoption Statistics\n",
       "\n",
       "ChatGPT has achieved the fastest technology adoption in recorded history. By July 2025, the platform reached over 750 million weekly active users, representing nearly 10% of the world's adult population [1]. The growth trajectory has been extraordinary: ChatGPT reached 1 million users within just 5 days of launch (by December 5, 2022) and achieved 100 million weekly active users within one year [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "The scale of daily engagement is staggering. By June 2025, users were sending more than 2.6 billion messages per day—equivalent to over 30,000 messages per second. This represents a dramatic increase from 451 million daily messages in June 2024 [7]. Weekly message volume reached 18 billion by July 2025, with weekly active users doubling every 7-8 months while message volume grew even faster at a 5.8x increase compared to 3.2x user growth [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Demographic Revolution: The Great Gender Reversal\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps the most striking finding concerns the complete transformation of ChatGPT's user demographics. Initially, over 80% of users had typically male names when the platform first launched. However, this gender composition underwent a dramatic reversal. By January 2024, 37% of users with identifiable names were feminine, and by July 2025, this figure reached 52%, indicating complete gender parity had been achieved [1][4].\n",
       "\n",
       "This represents one of the fastest demographic transitions documented in technology adoption history. The shift from a predominantly male user base to gender parity occurred in less than three years, defying typical patterns where new technologies maintain male-skewed adoption for extended periods.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Age Demographics and Generational Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "The platform demonstrates a pronounced younger user skew. Nearly half of all adult messages originate from users under 26 years old [4]. More specifically, 52.99% of users fall within the 18-34 age range, with more than 45% being under age 25 [2]. This generational concentration suggests that ChatGPT has become deeply integrated into the digital habits of younger demographics.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Education and Socioeconomic Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "Educational attainment correlates strongly with work-related usage patterns. More than 46% of users with a college degree use ChatGPT for work compared to 37% of those without a college degree [4]. Work usage is consistently more prevalent among educated users in highly-paid professional occupations, with writing tasks primarily originating from management and business occupations.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Global Democratization and Geographic Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "Contrary to typical technology adoption patterns that favor educated males from wealthy countries, ChatGPT adoption has shown rapid global democratization. By May 2025, adoption growth rates in the lowest income countries were over 4 times higher than in the highest income countries [1]. Countries at the 50th percentile of GDP per capita now demonstrate similar ChatGPT usage rates to those at the 90th percentile, despite vast income differences.\n",
       "\n",
       "The geographic distribution shows the United States leading with 17.2% of traffic, followed by India at 8.27% and Brazil at 5.73% [5]. This pattern indicates that AI access has genuinely democratized across economic boundaries, with middle-income countries showing particularly strong adoption rates.\n",
       "\n",
       "### User Engagement Evolution\n",
       "\n",
       "All user cohorts have significantly increased their usage beginning in late 2024 and early 2025 [1]. Early adopters from Q1 2023 are now sending 40% more messages per day than two years earlier, while users who signed up in late 2024 are sending nearly twice as many messages as when they first joined. Users spend an average of 7 minutes and 4 seconds per session, with an average of 4.5 pages viewed per visit and a bounce rate of 30.59% [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Most Common Use Cases and Conversation Taxonomy\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Big Three: Primary Usage Categories\n",
       "\n",
       "The research employed OpenAI's conversation classifier to identify usage patterns across millions of conversations. Three dominant categories account for nearly 80% of all ChatGPT usage [4]:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Practical Guidance**: 29% of all conversations - This category encompasses tutoring and teaching, how-to advice across various topics, and creative ideation [6][8]\n",
       "2. **Seeking Information**: 24% of all conversations - Includes searching for information about people, current events, products, and recipes, functioning as a close substitute for web search [6]\n",
       "3. **Writing**: 24% of all conversations - Encompasses automated production of emails, documents, and communications, plus editing, critiquing, summarizing, and translating user-provided text [6]\n",
       "\n",
       "These three categories collectively represent 77% of all conversations, demonstrating remarkable consistency in how people approach AI interaction [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Work Versus Non-Work Usage Revolution\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the most significant findings challenges assumptions about AI's primary value proposition. The data reveals a fundamental shift toward personal use over time. Non-work-related messages have grown dramatically from 53% in June 2024 to more than 70% of all usage by June 2025 [4][7]. This trend continues to accelerate, with about 73% of consumer ChatGPT use now being non-work related [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "This shift represents a paradigm change in AI adoption. While most economic analysis has focused on AI's impact on workplace productivity, the research demonstrates that personal, non-work applications are driving the majority of usage and growth.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Deep Dive into Writing Tasks\n",
       "\n",
       "Writing dominates work-related usage, representing approximately 40-42% of all work messages [4]. However, the nature of writing tasks reveals sophisticated usage patterns. Two-thirds of all writing messages ask ChatGPT to modify existing user text through editing, critiquing, translating, or other enhancement activities, rather than creating entirely new content from scratch [10]. This suggests users are leveraging AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human creativity.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Computer Programming: Debunking the Developer Myth\n",
       "\n",
       "Contrary to popular assumptions, computer programming accounts for only 4.2% of consumer conversations [7]. This low percentage debunks the widespread belief that ChatGPT is primarily a coding tool. The finding suggests that while programming applications receive significant media attention, they represent a small fraction of actual consumer usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Educational Applications and Learning\n",
       "\n",
       "Education represents 10.2% of all messages through tutoring or teaching functions [6]. This substantial portion indicates that ChatGPT has become an important supplementary educational resource, providing personalized learning support across various subjects and skill levels.\n",
       "\n",
       "### User Intent Classification: Asking, Doing, Expressing\n",
       "\n",
       "The researchers introduced an innovative \"Asking/Doing/Expressing\" taxonomy to categorize user interactions [5]:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Asking**: 49% of messages - Users seeking advice, guidance, or information [1][7]\n",
       "- **Doing**: 40% of messages - Users requesting task completion or performance [1][7]  \n",
       "- **Expressing**: 11% of messages - Personal reflection and exploration without specific information requests [1][7]\n",
       "\n",
       "For work-specific messages, \"Doing\" dominates at 56% due to immediate output needs [7]. Interestingly, \"Asking\" messages consistently receive higher quality ratings than other categories and have grown faster over time [6], suggesting that users find AI most valuable as an information and guidance resource.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Gender Differences in Application\n",
       "\n",
       "The study identified notable gender differences in usage patterns. Females are more likely to use ChatGPT for writing and practical guidance, while males tend to utilize it more for technical help and information seeking [4]. These patterns suggest that different demographic groups have discovered distinct value propositions within the same technology platform.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Trends and Patterns from the Data\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explosive Growth Trajectory\n",
       "\n",
       "The temporal growth data reveals unprecedented scaling. Daily message volume increased nearly six-fold from 451 million to 2.63 billion between June 2024 and June 2025 [7]. Weekly active users doubled from 400 million in February 2025 to 800 million by later in 2025 [5]. The platform now receives 5.8 billion monthly visits, representing a 7.606% month-over-month increase [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Behavioral Maturation Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "User engagement demonstrates consistent deepening over time as people discover new use cases and benefit from improved models [1]. All signup cohorts followed remarkably similar patterns: relatively flat usage through 2024, followed by substantial increases beginning in early 2025 [3]. This suggests increasing integration of ChatGPT into users' weekly and daily routines rather than episodic usage.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Information-Seeking Revolution\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the most significant behavioral shifts involves the growth of information-seeking conversations, which now represent 24% of all interactions, up from 14% a year earlier [6]. Researchers note this \"appears to be a very close substitute for web search,\" suggesting that \"if a quarter of conversations are information-seeking, some queries that would have gone to search may go toward conversational tools\" [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "This trend indicates that ChatGPT is becoming a major destination for finding information online, potentially reshaping how people access and interact with information on the internet.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Technical Support Usage Decline\n",
       "\n",
       "Interestingly, technical help usage dropped significantly from 12% in July 2024 to 5% in July 2025 [4]. This decline could indicate either improved user proficiency with the platform or the development of better self-service capabilities within the interface.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Economic Value and Consumer Surplus\n",
       "\n",
       "The study provides quantitative estimates of ChatGPT's economic value. U.S. users would need to be paid roughly $98 to give up generative AI for a month, implying at least $97 billion in annual consumer surplus in 2024 that traditional GDP measures don't capture [7]. This substantial figure demonstrates the significant economic value being created outside traditional measurement frameworks.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Decision Support as Core Value Proposition\n",
       "\n",
       "The research reveals that ChatGPT provides economic value primarily through decision support, which proves especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs [4]. About 81% of work-related messages involve obtaining/interpreting information and making decisions/solving problems [10]. This suggests that users view ChatGPT more as a thinking partner than simply a task automator, with users \"not just looking for labor automation. They are looking for clarity\" [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Global Accessibility and Digital Divide Implications\n",
       "\n",
       "The dramatic growth in lower-income countries, with adoption rates exceeding those of wealthier nations by more than four times [6], suggests that AI technologies may help bridge digital divides rather than exacerbate them. This democratization pattern represents a departure from typical technology adoption curves and could have significant implications for global economic development and educational access.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Privacy and Methodological Innovation\n",
       "\n",
       "The study employed groundbreaking privacy protection measures, including automated PII scrubbing, Data Clean Rooms for demographic analysis, and ensuring no researchers directly accessed message content or personal information [3]. The research analyzed over 1 million conversations using automated classifiers without human review of message content [10], demonstrating that large-scale behavioral research can be conducted while maintaining strict privacy standards.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Future Implications and Conclusions\n",
       "\n",
       "The research demonstrates that ChatGPT usage patterns are evolving rapidly, with 70% of use being personal rather than professional, indicating that \"consumer habits are changing broadly\" [6]. The platform has achieved a scale and integration level that positions it as a significant factor in how people access information, complete tasks, and make decisions in their daily lives.\n",
       "\n",
       "The findings challenge many assumptions about AI adoption and usage. Rather than being primarily a workplace productivity tool or coding assistant, ChatGPT has emerged as a versatile personal assistant that people use for decision support, creative guidance, and information discovery. The rapid achievement of gender parity and global democratization suggests that AI technologies may follow different adoption patterns than previous digital innovations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The economic implications are substantial, with billions of dollars in consumer surplus being generated outside traditional economic measurement systems. As AI technologies continue to evolve and integrate into daily life, understanding these usage patterns becomes crucial for policymakers, businesses, and researchers seeking to maximize the benefits while addressing potential challenges of widespread AI adoption.\n",
