# Build 🏗️

Run the repository and complete the following:

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #1 — Building and serving your LangGraph Agent Graph
  - Task 1: Getting Dependencies & Environment
    - Configure `.env` (OpenAI, Tavily, optional LangSmith)
  - Task 2: Serve the Graph Locally
    - `uv run langgraph dev` (API on http://localhost:2024)
  - Task 3: Call the API from a different terminal
    - `uv run test_served_graph.py` (sync SDK example)
  - Task 4: Explore assistants (from `langgraph.json`)
    - `agent` → `simple_agent` (tool-using agent)
    - `agent_helpful` → `agent_with_helpfulness` (separate helpfulness node)

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #2 — Using LangGraph Studio to visualize the graph
  - Task 1: Open Studio while the server is running
    - https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024
  - Task 2: Visualize & Stream
    - Start a run and observe node-by-node updates
  - Task 3: Compare Flows
    - Contrast `agent` vs `agent_helpful` (tool calls vs helpfulness decision)

## Activities and Questions 🏗️ &❓

#### ❓ Question 1:

Compare the `agent` and `agent_helpful` assistants defined in `langgraph.json`. Where does the helpfulness evaluator fit in the graph, and under what condition should execution route back to the agent vs. terminate?

##### ✅ Answer:
The hepfulness evaluator is positioned after the agent's response and only when then agent doesn't make any tool calls it gets invoked. The basic agent and  agent_helpful  helpfulness evaluation. The helpfulness evaluator runs after agent responses without tool calls, using GPT-4.1-mini to assess quality and route back to the agent if unhelpful or terminate if helpful. This creates a self-improving loop with a 10-message safety limit to prevent infinite iterations. 

Agent:
Yes--> Action to tools
No --> Route to helpfullness
then helpfulness decision :
If not response is No then sends back to agent to get better response. 
If Yes, meaning response is helpful or the messages exceed 10 then it terminates to stop the infinite loop

#### 🏗️ Activity #1 Debugging A Graph

Select the `agent_with_helpfulness` and set one or more interrupts (at least one `Before` and one `After`). Try changing values and continuing the turn. 

#### ❓ Question 2:

What are your thoughts on when you would use a Before interrupt vs. an After interrupt?

##### ✅ Answer:

Before interrupt is useful to validate/get clarificatio and modify inputs, inject some parameters like password or token or API Keys; basically where human involvement is needed. For example: Approval workflows for a discount/refund after a certain threshold or get confirmation on use email, phone or account id in customer support cases

After interrupt is useful to validate response from agent, check quality before adding any post processing workflows and also capture any metrics. For ex: Before logging a case check for compliance and refund policies, run security scans for authentication flow or agent response tone in the customer support use cases
