        "The comprehensive evaluation of seven advanced retrieval methods reveals BM25 as the clear winner from this experiement overall, achieving the optimal balance of performance, cost, and speed. While BM25 delivers 80% context recall and 73.32% answer relevancy with low 0.004s latency, the most concerning finding is the systematic failure across all methods in faithfulness (0-10%) and factual correctness (0%). This suggests the core issue lies not in retrieval quality but in response generation, indicating potential problems with the LLM prompting strategy or evaluation setup.\n",

        "Context Recall: Most methods achieve 80% (except ensemble 60%, semantic/compression 70%)\n",
        "Answer Relevancy: All methods perform similarly (72-73%)\n",
        "Faithfulness: Consistently low across all methods (0-10%) - critical issue\n",
        "Factual Correctness: All methods score 0% - major red flag\n",

        "Most Cost-Effective: BM25 - no LLM calls, minimal resources, scalable\n",
        "Most Expensive: Ensemble & Multi-Query - multiple LLM calls, high overhead, diminishing returns\n",

        "\n",
        "BM25 - best overall performance with minimal cost and fastest response times\n",
        "Parent Document for high quality retrieval - only method with 10% faithfulness and reasonable latency (1.30s)\n",
        "Use Ensemble & Multi-Query only when high quality and precision is required as it incurs high cost with minimal performance gains and complex implementation"
